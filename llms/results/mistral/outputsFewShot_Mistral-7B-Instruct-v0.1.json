  "0": "Keeping the secret of genetic testing.",
  "1": "What is genetic risk ?",
  "2": "Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease.",
  "3": "People get certain diseases because of genetic changes.",
  "4": "How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear.",
  "5": "If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it does not mean that you will definitely develop heart disease.",
  "6": "The opposite is also true.",
  "7": "If your genetic results show that you do not have any changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it is still possible that you develop heart disease.",
  "8": " However, for some rare diseases, people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease.",
  "9": "When we are diagnosed with certain genetic diseases, are we supposed to disclose this result to our relatives ?",
  "10": "My answer is no.",
  "11": "On one hand, we do not want this potential danger causing frightening effects in our families' later lives.",
  "12": "When people around us know that we have a certain disease, their attitudes will easily be changed, whether they care about us too much or keep away from us.",
  "13": "And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people.",
  "14": "Surrounded by such concerns, it is very likely that we are distracted and worried about these problems.",
  "15": "It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life, because we will never know when a potential bomb will explode.",
  "16": "On the other hand, if there are ways we can help control or cure the disease, we can go through this process as a whole family.",
  "17": "For example, if exercising is beneficial for the prevention of potential diseases, we can always look for more opportunities for the family to go exercise.",
  "18": "And we keep track of all family members' health conditions.",
  "19": "At the same time, we are prepared to know when other members get this disease.",
  "20": "Here, I want to share my view on this issue.",
  "21": "Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington\u2019s disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings, there currently is no legal requirement to do so.",
  "22": "In fact, requiring someone to communicate their own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious.",
  "23": "Original sentence: \"",
  "24": "Nothing is absolutely right or wrong.",
  "25": "If certain genetic diseases have genetic tests that are very accurate and are unavoidable and necessary for treatment and known to others, it is OK to disclose the result.",
  "26": " Above all, life is more important than secrets.",
  "27": "Genetic risk carries its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle.",
  "28": " After all, what affects one family may or may not affect another, although the families may have a common genetic makeup, shared by either of the parents.",
  "29": " In cases where an individual has learned about a genetic disorder, disclosing or otherwise to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the individual's moral system.",
  "30": "The issue of whether or not to disclose genetic information is highly debatable, although it is considered a genetic risk. One cannot be entirely certain, as the genetic information could potentially result from the families of either parent, including their maternal and paternal uncles, aunts, or cousins.",
  "31": "This also implies that as soon as a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile, he or she simultaneously has knowledge about others.",
  "32": " This knowledge may be relevant to them, and vice versa.",
  "33": "An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer.",
  "34": "It is hereditary.",
  "35": "Do one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret and inform their relatives?",
  "36": "In retrospect, it is also one's duty to ensure that he or she undergoes periodic health checkups.",
  "37": "Sometimes, family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication.",
  "38": " Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from - son or daughter for example - the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and who takes precedence in being \"allowed\" to tell the news.",
  "39": "For example, within a family, regardless of who had first received genetic information, parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring, either the adult at risk or the offspring.",
  "40": " In addition, a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than doing it herself, although this may be further complicated by an individual's response to risk information, as they may not want to know.",
  "41": "Hence, there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know (such as nieces and nephews) nor persuade those with authority (the parents) to do so.",
  "42": "The notion of authority also extended vertically.",
  "43": "For example, a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt, even when she is not at genetic risk herself while she may not be.",
  "44": "From a practitioner's perspective, these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are social constructs, they may not be in line with geneticists' views of family relationships, or about which blood (or non-blood) relatives should be informed and by whom; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context.",
  "45": "Ultimately, one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assisting those at risk to make informed decisions about disclosure",
  "46": "Whose duty it is to inform at-risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of the risk, as well as its perceived directness to them.",
  "47": "People with close blood relationships generally carry some similar genes.",
  "48": "In this case, if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk, it is better for the patient to notify their close relatives about the issue and to inform others, so that they may be able to perform certain risk assessments to prevent the potential disease or to go to a hospital for further testing.",
  "49": "In my opinion, although the announcement of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self-privacy, it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to inform his or her relatives about the issue in order for them to prevent the potential disease.",
  "50": "I agree with this statement to a large extent.",
  "51": "Focus on the negative side of the announcement of genetic risk first.",
  "52": "Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicate their high chance to carry certain diseases.",
  "53": " Especially for young people without marriage, if they are known to have some genetic risk, it may have a certain chance that their child could carry the same disease, but not necessarily.",
  "54": "Therefore, to keep the information as a secret from his or her future spouse would help the relationship.",
  "55": "Secondly, the announcement of the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue, although the factor would not be that serious, people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future, thus go to the hospital and do additional checks or take more medicine to prevent the disease, and this creates unnecessary costs to the family.",
  "56": " Furthermore, the announcement of genetic risk may affect relationships with relatives as some others may think that it is not safe to stay too close to the carrier, thereby reducing the chances of getting the potential disease.",
  "57": "On the other hand, if the genetic risk is kept as a secret, although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extent and help to keep the privacy, but it has much larger negative impacts on the family members and relatives.",
  "58": "First, for the case of marriage, people should be honest and tell their spouse about any potential genetic risks that may affect their offsprings.",
  "59": "It is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born and a certain type of genetic disease is found.",
  "60": "It is better for both parties to be honest.",
  "61": "Secondly , genetics has a close relationship with the genes we inherit, as well as our daily habits.",
  "62": "For example, if a carrier is told that they have the risk to have diabetes.",
  "63": "In this case, the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent intake of too much sugars, and at the same time, if the carrier shares this information with relatives, it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future because of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease.",
  "64": " Otherwise, if the other parties did not know, they may end up with diabetes in the future without any prevention.",
  "65": "In conclusion, we could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carrier relatives far outweigh the costs.",
  "66": " Therefore, it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to inform the information to the relatives, in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises.",
  "67": "among all kinds of different diseases, a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons.",
  "68": " Genetic disorders may or may not be inherited or hereditary diseases, and it's sometimes difficult to determine if one has these kinds of conditions.",
  "69": "It is a long-standing discussion that whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by a gene mutation.",
  "70": "But, from an ethical aspect, the answer should be yes.",
  "71": "We can't make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell their relatives about their genetic problem.",
  "72": " It is immoral and impractical.",
  "73": "Firstly, someone having which diseases belong to their privacy.",
  "74": "Privacy protection belongs to one's human rights.",
  "75": " If a law requires someone to disclose their privacy especially when they are not willing to do so.",
  "76": "It is against his or her human rights and it is against the spirit of the law.",
  "77": "The law's spirit also includes fairness.",
  "78": "What is the basic difference between genetic disorders and other disorders?",
  "79": "It is unfair to release a law that only points to a genetic disorder.",
  "80": "In addition, it is impractical to make such a law.",
  "81": "A good law should be clear and easy for members to execute.",
  "82": "However, there are many problems against the execution of asking a carrier to tell their relatives the cause of their diseases.",
  "83": "Firstly, what is the range of the relatives?",
  "84": " For example, does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and siblings, or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother's sister's son's daughter's nephew?",
  "85": "If you say \"only need to tell direct relatives,\" it will be against the fairness of the law.",
  "86": "Other relatives may have the same possibility to have such a kind of disease.",
  "87": "How can a law made by the government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potential disease?",
  "88": " However, from an ethical point of view.",
  "89": "To the carrier of the genetic disorder themselves, they should have a feeling of responsibility to tell their relatives about it.",
  "90": " By doing this, they may be able to save some lives of their relatives.",
  "91": "It is because a person with a bad gene may not necessarily have those genetic diseases, if they can have corresponding healthy lifestyles before the age that the gene's function becomes stronger.",
  "92": "A typical example of is genetic - caused hypertension.",
  "93": " Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems, such as those that make it harder for the body to digest fat and salt in the blood, which can lead to high blood pressure.",
  "94": "People usually get this kind of hypertension after they become adults.",
  "95": " However, if they already know they have a gene that may increase their chances of getting hypertension, then their doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to lower their risk.",
  "96": "They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus avoid hypertension.",
  "97": " In a nutshell, our society can't push genetic problem carriers to tell their disease to their relatives, but they should be willing to tell their relatives about their genetic problem.",
  "98": "By doing so, fewer of their beloved ones will suffer from the genetic problem.",
  "99": "In the age of rapid technological advancement, medical breakthroughs are made possible.",
  "100": "Genetic testing is made possible and available for individuals to undergo.",
  "101": "Input sentence: It is able to detect illnesses or diseases and even a child's parentage.\nIt is able to detect illnesses or diseases and even determine a child's parentage.",
  "102": " However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives.",
  "103": "If the genetic risk was shared within the family or relatives, there might be chances for them to have it in their blood, which they may have necessary precautions to prevent.",
  "104": " But , if it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease, most of the relatives will be disheartened upon having the knowledge about it.",
  "105": "Therefore, some carriers will keep it as a secret.",
  "106": "This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives or not.",
  "107": " Some said that the genetic risk found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered personal information that should be kept confidential.",
  "108": "Most patients will be depressed after realizing their conditions.",
  "109": "If one has a genetic disease after the test, he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he or she might end up disappointing the extended family.",
  "110": "Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimism into their family.",
  "111": " Furthermore, some people will wish not to be a burden to anyone because seeking medical attention can be relatively costly.",
  "112": "I assume you meant to say: \"Therefore, some people consider it to be unethical to keep their genetic risk of getting the disease confidential.\"",
  "113": "On the other hand, others may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk.",
  "114": "Hence, they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or take measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease.",
  "115": " Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases are given in the context of current medical technology.",
  "116": "For example, breast cancer is a genetic disease, and it can be cured if it's realized in the early stage.",
  "117": "Hence, with the knowledge of having a genetic risk, the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up, which might save them from realizing it at an earlier stage.",
  "118": "In conclusion, it would be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives.",
  "119": " Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention, such as financial issues, everyone should be given the right to know their family's inherited medical conditions.",
  "120": "However, some think it might be better for those who are ignorant about it and will continue living a happy life.",
  "121": "In addition, some may think that even knowing about having a genetic risk of the disease will just add to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it.",
  "122": "All in all, it depends on the individual and the nature of the disease, but he or she should be obligated to inform their relatives if there are any possibilities of curing or preventing it.",
  "123": "Genetic testing is a personal decision, with the knowledge that there is a possibility that one could be a carrier or not.",
  "124": "Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing, even if there is no risk involved.",
  "125": "Early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected.",
  "126": "For a genetic risk carrier, there should be a choice given regarding informing his/her relatives.",
  "127": "There should not be forced or obliged to do so as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier.",
  "128": "With regard to this choice given, there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision-making.",
  "129": "If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child, then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with the consideration of the patient's parents or legal guardian.",
  "130": "Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of such a genetic disorder due to their young age.",
  "131": "Furthermore, informing others without the consent of their parents or the patients themselves could harm the psychological state of the affected family member.",
  "132": "Thus, much thought need to be put on the immediate family, as it could cause a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members themselves.",
  "133": "Some families may feel hurt, with regards to their family pride or reputation, on having the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family.",
  "134": "However, there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder.",
  "135": " There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect the relatives and any other families within the same family tree.",
  "136": "The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder.",
  "137": "Also, this known information will help their relatives make informed decisions and undergo genetic testing to determine the outcome.",
  "138": "Thus, having the knowledge that such a genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotional thoughts.",
  "139": " And if the results turn out to be otherwise, then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions.",
  "140": " In addition, the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is made known to them.",
  "141": "Having support from relatives is vital as they ensure genetic risk carriers that they are not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder, which could be inherited by anyone in the family.",
  "142": "Therefore, the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent on the situation and background of the affected family, with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others.",
  "143": " A person with a disorder, regardless of whether it is mental or physical, is always easy to be aware of by his or her families.",
  "144": "When genetic issues arise, it is no longer that simple.",
  "145": " Genetic disorder inheritance is passed from generation to generation, but not all of the offsprings show the relevant symptoms.",
  "146": "Sometimes, a family with a potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies because none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms.",
  "147": "As a result, in the case where one of the members happens to feel uncomfortable or abnormal, he or she should be aware whether the disorder in their body is a genetic risk or not.",
  "148": "Afterward , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue: whether or not to reveal the problem to his or her relatives.",
  "149": "If the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid, the parent will be informed for sure by the medics, and the whole family will stay alert to their bodies' condition.",
  "150": "On the contrary, if the carrier is an adult who has the right to choose whether to inform their relatives about the risks, that will be more complex.",
  "151": "One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than themselves , there is no doubt that they will tell their family about the issue.",
  "152": " That is true, and, of course, it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family.",
  "153": "Think of another way, if a family member knows that he has the risk of becoming a genetic risk carrier and passing on it to his child in the future, his whole life will be in a dilemma.",
  "154": "And of course , they will think of not having any children after getting married, and the same thought goes to the cousins as well.",
  "155": "As a result, the previous generation stops by the moment the adult caregiver announces his issue.",
  "156": " In China, the older generation, with traditional culture background, will always think of having more children and grandchildren to make the family lively and stronger.",
  "157": " The reason is that after World War II, the population of China decreased dramatically, and so the government encouraged the people to have more births.",
  "158": " During that period, if one of the family members reflects genetic disorder symptoms, he will certainly be faced with an ethical dilemma.",
  "159": "The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him.",
  "160": "He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperous with a potential generic risk.",
  "161": "And so, he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever.",
  "162": " This kind of ethical issue cannot be judged by others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family.",
  "163": "In conclusion, people should think carefully about the consequences of telling their relatives about their generic disorder issues.",
  "164": "It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives, but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family.",
  "165": "Regardless of whether the disorder is rarely fatal or does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier, revealing the truth is always the right thing to do.",
  "166": "In my opinion, the carrier should inform its relatives about it.",
  "167": "One of the reasons is because as a carrier, she/he needs mental support to go through this situation.",
  "168": "It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on their own.",
  "169": " By telling her family other than being a support, they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now.",
  "170": "Other than that, I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to our career.",
  "171": "Furthermore, as it is a genetic problem, it will be better for the carrier to inform their family, as other family members might experience the same thing.",
  "172": " By being aware of this genetic problem, they can have a full check-up for themselves and it will be better if they can even prevent it from happening to themselves.",
  "173": "I find it especially important to inform if the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to society, as it is contagious.",
  "174": "For every action, there are always pros and cons.",
  "175": "I believe that some of the carriers will choose not to reveal their disease to their family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them.",
  "176": " Furthermore, as it could incur spending a lot of money for the treatment, the carrier might not want to be a burden on her family.",
  "177": "I could understand the feeling of the carrier.",
  "178": "She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family.",
  "179": "However, we will never know whether this negative effect will happen when the carrier informs his or her family of their condition.",
  "180": " In conclusion, personally, I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue.",
  "181": "The carrier should be honest with their feelings, and I find that it is the right of family members to know what is going on in their lives.",
  "182": "If anything is wrong with the carrier's life, without informing the family members, it could make a huge regret for them if she leaves without them knowing about it.",
  "183": " On top of that, it is better to brainstorm solutions for her problem with the family members, as there are more minds to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own.",
  "184": " I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help carriers fight against genetic diseases.",
  "185": "True enough that there are lots of cancer patients who were given a second chance to live as normal people as they have strong mental support from their loved ones.",
  "186": "In my opinion, as long as we keep our minds healthy and strong, we can fight any disease that comes to us when we are fragile and weak.",
  "187": " As technology has been advancing, it has reached a stage where the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the actual use of the technology.",
  "188": "Genetic testing has been made possible- it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing.",
  "189": " If used for a good purpose, it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness. However, it could also make the situation worse by revealing a family member, in the family.",
  "190": "The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their relatives, and I believe that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I believe that they have the right not to know.",
  "191": "Firstly, genetic testing is not something that is compulsory.",
  "192": "Of course, some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier. However, the carrier, before the testing, can choose not to go for the test and simply live with the unknowns and accept the facts.",
  "193": "If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that genetic testing holds and is willing to accept it, he could do that, and it has been something that was \"normal\" to everyone in the past as genetic testing was not possible.",
  "194": "It could rather be better for him or her this way.",
  "195": "Some people might say that it is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real-life.",
  "196": "I personally think this is the right purpose of going through genetic testing, so that families who cannot afford to have a disabled child do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer.",
  "197": " However, I believe that the carrier has a right not to be obligated to inform anyone, but has a responsibility to take action to prevent any ethical dilemma.",
  "198": " If the result turned out something that the carrier could not accept, it would have been better if I had not known the truth.",
  "199": "I believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the true facts.",
  "200": " After realizing he or she is the carrier, the emotional damage would be hard to bear.",
  "201": "It could possibly cause a problem in a family due to the fact that it creates more unhappiness in the family.",
  "202": " Overall, I believe it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face them with their relatives, but they have no obligation to reveal it altogether.",
  "203": " In fact, I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and take an appropriate action to the results.",
  "204": "The emotional depression that the carrier might experience and the sense of guilt can be more than expected and could be a burden in mind for the rest of life.",
  "205": " On the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the disability.",
  "206": "I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is, without having emotional stress.",
  "207": "Debates have been around for years about whether a carrier for a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives.",
  "208": "Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing, but whether the results should be informed to others, especially close family or relatives, is a topic that's worth discussing.",
  "209": "This is an issue that needs to be addressed, as a family-related ethical dilemma is involved.",
  "210": "In this essay, a few arguments will be pointed out in support of the view that carriers of known genetic risk should tell their relatives.",
  "211": " When we were born, we were surrounded by our family and relatives, with them welcoming us to this new world.",
  "212": "We were crying hard, but we are not alone; it's our family and relatives who grow us up.",
  "213": "Hence , they should be the people we be grateful for and the people with whom we would like to share joy together.",
  "214": "However, in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of a serious disorder, it may seem no point of sharing, but this involves more than just sharing of bad news.",
  "215": "One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone, but it is also one's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives.",
  "216": " As the case of health issues is related to genetic risks, with the keyword \"genetic\" highlighting the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation.",
  "217": " As a result, I would agree that it is necessary for a carrier of known genetic risk to inform their relatives and avoid any family-related ethical dilemmas that may arise in the future.",
  "218": "Despite one may argue that it's still up to the individual to disclose such a health issue or to bear it within themselves, it's certainly helpful to share with close relatives, for a proper discussion for solutions.",
  "219": "By doing so, one will feel less stressful in facing such disordered risks.",
  "220": "Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more caring towards a person who carries a known genetic risk.",
  "221": "By informing them, the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle against such disorder risks.",
  "222": " On top of that, as the genetic risk may pass down to future generations, it will involve more than just one family.",
  "223": "It is therefore I would agree to the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and has a plan for giving birth.",
  "224": "This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas.",
  "225": "There are more intangible advantages that could support informing the relatives after the test results are known.",
  "226": "In conclusion, in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma, it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives.",
  "227": "The benefits of doing so are able to outweigh its disadvantages.",
  "228": "More supports must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing at such junction, whether he/she should inform the relatives or not.",
  "229": "The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder.",
  "230": "This is the common law in society.",
  "231": " However, it leads to a new problem: should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives?",
  "232": "The input sentence \"This issue has been discussed for a long time\" is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes.",
  "233": " Even so, there is still a diversity of opinions among the people.",
  "234": "Thus, we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue, which is \"should or should not\".",
  "235": "Firstly, I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below: \"I will be anxious about my families when they told me that they were carriers of a known genetic risk.\"",
  "236": "Frequently, the intention of the carriers is to continue their own life without the anxieties of their families.",
  "237": "It is obvious that one person will be more worried than many.",
  "238": " However, many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges themselves.",
  "239": "With the families' support, there must be more energy to fight against the demon.",
  "240": "A demon is not easily defeated and requires much energy and psychological support.",
  "241": "Families give you the courage and support which you can't retrieve by yourself.",
  "242": "The most essential elements to overcome challenges.",
  "243": "Besides that, the risk associated with the known genetic disorder is very serious and cannot be fully described.",
  "244": "The seriousness can be larger than our imagination.",
  "245": "Lying on the bed for the remainder of life, and even dying immediately, these are the consequences which we cannot imagine.",
  "246": "Families are the dearest in our lives.",
  "247": "Without their concern and support, we are hard to stay until this time.",
  "248": "They play an important role in our lives that cannot be substituted.",
  "249": "A known genetic risk can also critically affect our next generation.",
  "250": " Therefore, it is our responsibility to inform our relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences.",
  "251": "Generally, the clinic or hospital will not inform a carrier's family without their agreement.",
  "252": "It is the ethical obligation of hospital staff to keep the secret of any patient.",
  "253": "We cannot blame them if they are liable to undesired consequences.",
  "254": "However, the hospital can provide a counselor to advise the carrier about the actions that can be taken.",
  "255": "Therefore, this kind of circumstance will not happen again and again.",
  "256": "It is a method that benefits two parties, which is a win-win situation.",
  "257": " In conclusion, carriers of a known genetic risk are encouraged to tell their relatives about the known genetic risk.",
  "258": " However, there may be some special cases that are hard to define.",
  "259": "Thus, advice from the hospital plays an important role for this.",
  "260": "A carrier is responsible for balancing their own interests and the benefits of family and society.",
  "261": "It is a hard decision to make, but with the most appropriate way, it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future.",
  "262": "With the risk of being genetically disordered, many individuals have made the decision to undergo genetic testing.",
  "263": "With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done, each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier faces an ethical problem: They should warn their relatives about the risk of being the same genetic risk carrier.",
  "264": "Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carryer is diagnosed.",
  "265": "In my view, a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives, with the support of the following reasons:\n\n1. Genetic testing can be emotionally and psychologically taxing, and disclosing such information can cause significant distress and stress to the subject and their loved ones.\n2. Due to the potential for harm, such as fear, anxiety, and depression, and the potential for discrimination, ostracism, or even harm, it can be more beneficial for carriers not to disclose this information.\n3. Genetic test results can be uncertain, and disclosure could result in unintended consequences, such as stigmatization, discrimination, or further psychological harm.\n4. Privacy and confidentiality should be respected, even if the carrier has a moral or ethical obligation to share this information with their relatives.\n5. Other options, such as counseling, support groups, or genetic counseling, can be considered for the carrier to help them navigate this difficult decision and minimize harm.\n\nIn summary, while genetic testing is important to identify potential risks, it is also important to balance this with the well-being and privacy of the subject and their loved ones.",
  "266": "First of all, from the perspective of human rights, a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to disclose the truth to others.",
  "267": "This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy to carriers.",
  "268": "They may not want this truth to influence their lives or want to keep it as a secret and not let others know about it.",
  "269": "This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth about being a carrier may make them be discriminated against or sympathized by others, which are not positive factors brought into their lives.",
  "270": "Secondly, the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing, regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier.",
  "271": "When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers, they can go to a doctor for consultation.",
  "272": "If they do not want to think too much about it and view it as a trouble, they may just ignore the possibility.",
  "273": " However, if a diagnosed carrier is obligated to tell their relatives, it will force them to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers.",
  "274": "This obeys their own willingness; as in, they have to accept the truth which may make their following life miserable.",
  "275": "Many people Many argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of the carriers , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early diagnosis.",
  "276": " However, this is not exactly true when other factors, including psychological influence and social influence, are taken into consideration.",
  "277": "If one such relative is told that they may have a higher risk of getting sick, they may be scared about the uncertain aspects of life, such as relationships, partnerships, and colleagues. Many other situations may also arise, which could potentially ruin their life.",
  "278": "On the other side, as stated above, a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually.",
  "279": "In a nutshell, a person who carries a known genetic risk should have the right to decide whether or not to inform their relatives.",
  "280": "This should be accepted from the point of human right, the freedom of acceptance of relatives, as well as many other social reasons.",
  "281": "Otherwise, making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives.",
  "282": " For a carrier of a genetic disorder to know that he or she is a carrier, it causes more dilemma rather than getting the disorder.",
  "283": "I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives about it.",
  "284": " There are four reasons why people don't have to be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorders.",
  "285": " Firstly , the carrier and their family can take precautions, physically by actions to reduce the chance of it being inherited by offspring, and mentally if the action fails to prevent it from being inherited.",
  "286": "Many syndromes such as Down Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome can be prevented if the mother undergoes proper medication and does not consume harmful goods during the pregnancy period.",
  "287": "This information may not be known by the mother if she does not tell her relatives regarding her condition.",
  "288": "More people (relatives) know her problems, more information channels are provided.",
  "289": "If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome, then the family has to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children's growth.",
  "290": "This is not the parent's fault because there is still a chance of the gene being inherited.",
  "291": " So, they also have to prepare mentally.",
  "292": "Secondly, genetic diseases can be extremely costly for treatment and medication.",
  "293": "Albinism is one of the examples.",
  "294": "The people with albinism have sensitive skin that needs regular treatment.",
  "295": "Unlike people with high proportion of skin pigment, people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases.",
  "296": "If they do not treat their body well, such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen in outdoor activities, the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer.",
  "297": "Once you are diagnosed with cancer, the cost of medication is very expensive.",
  "298": "To prevent bigger problems from happening, it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body",
  "299": "If the carrier doesn't tell his or her relatives, it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially.",
  "300": "Thirdly, some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems.",
  "301": "One of the diseases is sickle cell trait.",
  "302": "Usually, people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene, which may lead to circulatory problems such as blood clotting and blockage.",
  "303": "If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives, then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing. They do not need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children's health.",
  "304": "Fourthly, it is important for the parents to give their children with genetic disorders a mental boost.",
  "305": "When their children become teenagers, a lot of social problems may arise.",
  "306": " People and friends often mock at your conditions.",
  "307": "A strong mental condition and conviction must be built from within and from the closest ones.",
  "308": "If not their family, then who else is willing to do that?",
  "309": "It is not a heavy job for the family if they prepare their mental first by disclosing the information about the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder.",
  "310": "In this modern world, the technologies have been improved significantly compared to those from the past century.",
  "311": " Specifically, in the medical field, there has been a great improvement in many treatments for many previously incurable diseases, and genetic testing is one of the methods that have been used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder.",
  "312": "The medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing.",
  "313": "However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known, a family-related ethical dilemma is born.",
  "314": "The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives about it.",
  "315": "In my opinion, the carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives about this.",
  "316": "This is because his or her relatives have the right to know about this.",
  "317": "As many people realize, a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier's relatives, that is, one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder. This means that other family members have almost the equally risk to have it as well, so this problem should be treated seriously by the family.",
  "318": "Every family member has the right to know what is going on with them.",
  "319": "If they do not even know they are at risk for a genetic disorder, how can this explain their right to it?",
  "320": "For instance, John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder, but he doesn't tell his sibling, James about this.",
  "321": "Although telling James about this is terrible to some extent, he should know what is likely to be going on for him.",
  "322": "This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risks associated with having this disorder.",
  "323": "The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having a similar genetic disorder, preventing such genetic disorders from affecting themselves.",
  "324": "Genetic disorders are innate, but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves.",
  "325": "In addition, doctors usually quote a statement, \"Prevention is better than cure\"; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder from happening has far more advantages than curing it.",
  "326": "Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person, and therefore, this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible.",
  "327": "For example, hypertension is partially due to genetic factors, but environmental factors also play an important role.",
  "328": "People who are aware of having such a disorder can prevent the disorder from happening by adapting a healthy lifestyle, including having a balanced diet and at least 30 minutes of exercise every day.",
  "329": "To sum up, a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives.",
  "330": "This is their human right to know about that, and this may also save their lives by preventing the disease from happening.",
  "331": " Together with the advancement of technology over the past decades, medical advancements have increased exponentially, and further enhancements are still constantly upgrading. Empower doctors with advance medical knowledge, doctors are able to diagnose and undergo genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their lives. However, once a test has been conducted, and the results are known, the issue of disclosing the results to the relatives can be challenging for both the patient and the doctor. In my opinion, the obligation to inform patient relatives should be supported and made mandatory in the healthcare industry.",
  "332": "As it is a genetic risk, being a next-of-skin means that a patient might inherit the risk, hence why it is important to inform their relatives of this so that necessary prevention actions can be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur. For example, if a person has only one child and a genetic disease that could be passed on to the next generation, sharing this information can lessen stress and suffering on the family. However, there are ethical concerns like discrimination and privacy that can be barriers to disclose information to relatives, potentially leading to a violation of the privacy and confidentiality principles. Currently, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in the United States, there is no legal obligation to disclose information to relatives, it is up to the patient's wishes. Early disclosure to family members can bring positive results and prevention, as seen in the case of Angelina Jolie, who chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to significantly reduce the risk of breast cancer to under five percent. Her reason for disclosing her own story was that she did not want to live under the shadow of cancer.",
  "333": "However, there are still people against the decision of revealing private information, as in the case of Alzheimer patients, it is up to the patient's own choice to disclose information. However, research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who, how, and whom will Alzheimer's disease be disclosed to minimize potential negative impact to family members (DementiaToday, 2012). There are associations that provide help to Alzheimer patients like the Alzheimer's Association (Alzheimer's Association, 1980). Although there are still thousands of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone, the need to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an absolute help that patients need in their difficult time.",
  "334": " In conclusion, the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors on when to reveal to relatives members about genetic diseases, and in what situations it is open to the patient's decision. In addition, the state could also encourage the creation of assistance schemes to provide necessary help to needy patients, thereby encouraging them to open up for the benefit of themselves and their families. Though it may face challenges from social ethical issues, with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government, more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and that of their loved ones.",
  "335": "Nowadays, the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement.",
  "336": "Not long ago, the human genome project sponsored by several large multinational corporations (MNCs) has been started.",
  "337": "In comparison, in the field of genetic testing, which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder, as the technology has already been very mature for some time now, an even more popular topic arises.",
  "338": "While most people agree that each individual has the right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not, they have different opinions on whether it is the patient's responsibility or freedom to share the result with their relatives.",
  "339": "In my opinion, the patients, who are carriers of some known genetic risks, are supposed to share the truth with their family members.",
  "340": "Admittedly, it is a social obligation to be responsible for the life of other people.",
  "341": "To the whole society, it is a duty.",
  "342": "Take H1N1 as an example. All the people in Singapore, including students at school, travelers at the Changi Airport, workers in the office, and passengers on the street, are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge of managing the outbreak.",
  "343": "To those family members who care about them, it is also a moral obligation.",
  "344": "How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger?",
  "345": "The foundation of a family is built on trust and love, with no doubts.",
  "346": "Without trust and love, there is no difference between a family and a group of strangers living together.",
  "347": "Hence, it is essential to inform their family members about the risks of their genetic disorder as a social responsibility and a favor to preserve the family basis.",
  "348": "Moreover, telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support.",
  "349": "Without the support of loved ones, patients' life is no better than death.",
  "350": "Family members, as one of the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort, is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder.",
  "351": " A study by New York University in 2010 showed that patients with family members around generally recover 2-4 days faster than those taken care by professional nurses.",
  "352": " Even for those patients with terminal diseases, the duration of their survival is 30% longer due to family support.",
  "353": "Some people may say that telling the truth may give rise to some unnecessary doubts and panic which will endanger the family harmony.",
  "354": "While every family must go through some troublesome situations, the more troubles they have gone through together, the greater the bond that will be established between the family members, as well as the greater amount of trust, love, and understanding.",
  "355": "Hence, for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other, all these troubles are just testimonies to make them stronger.",
  "356": "Also, the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson are just like what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.",
  "357": "Being in Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice, I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether they want to tell their relatives about their disease.",
  "358": "The courage to take genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental, while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case.",
  "359": "Furthermore, since it is the person's gene that is affected, they have the right to determine with whom they want to share the information with.",
  "360": " Nevertheless , while I feel that a carrier should not be obligated to tell her or his relatives about the genetic risk, I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with their potential partner (husband or wife) since the individual's genetic risk may affect their future children.",
  "361": " Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases, andmany of them will most likely judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or \"weird.\"",
  "362": " This is because many people relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble-Boy disease, autism, or Down syndrome.",
  "363": "In those diseases, many who are affected actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic disorders.",
  "364": "While we know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations, many people still do it without realizing it.",
  "365": "In this particular case, we are discussing whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a risk of a particular genetic disease.",
  "366": "It is normal for people to demand fair and similar treatment as others and therefore it is normal for people to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case they are judged or treated differently. Many people love to hear what they want to hear and therefore may just ignore the word \"risk\" and assume that the person has suffered from the disease.",
  "367": "To prevent that from happening, I think it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may be paranoid or judge him and act differently.",
  "368": "Especially when it is just a risk, the option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer.",
  "369": "There may be some people who believe it is necessary to inform family members about the risks because some of them may be affected, while I do agree with this viewpoint. However, how much trust you can put in your family regarding this issue may also be a factor.",
  "370": "Maybe we can trust our immediate family members but can we really trust all the other relatives?",
  "371": "Furthermore, since genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case, it is up to the person's call to disclose such information to their relatives.",
  "372": " However, as I said earlier, it is better for the person to at least disclose any potential risks to their future partner, since their genetic risk may affect their children later.",
  "373": " This information needs to be acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children.",
  "374": "There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers and therefore they should not have any children since their child may not be able to survive, even after they are born.",
  "375": "Or in a less extreme case, the child may be disabled.",
  "376": " This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters; therefore, although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone, it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner.",
  "377": " In conclusion, whether or not the carrier wants to share his genetic risk with his relatives, the decision is his because it is his own gene, and he has the right to make that decision.",
  "378": "He may have different considerations other than judging people or may result in making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives. No matter what choice he makes, we need to respect it and we have no right to tell him that he must tell his relatives about it.",
  "379": "We all know that life is priceless, and we have no right to judge a person's death.",
  "380": "With the advancements in technology, a new life with genetic risks can be detected.",
  "381": "Genetic refers to the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease.",
  "382": " Therefore, an entirely new dilemma arises: should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives?",
  "383": "This essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have a genetic risk.",
  "384": "One of the reasons that parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable of raising a child with a genetic risk.",
  "385": " Children with genetic risk may not have the ability to work and support their families as well as their peers.",
  "386": "They may not be able to enjoy a normal life as others can enjoy.",
  "387": "This competitive world is cruel to those who are not able to survive.",
  "388": "Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to foster their child if he/she is not able to foster himself/herself.",
  "389": "The situation may become worst if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease, which means that parents have another heavy burden named medication fees.",
  "390": "Not only the child but also the entire family will suffer.",
  "391": "It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that is unable to work and may suffer pain throughout their entire life.",
  "392": "The other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a carrier of genetic risk is for the nation's good.",
  "393": "There are always newspaper reports that a newborn baby has been abandoned at a hospital after they realized that the baby has diseases that require a huge amount of money to secure.",
  "394": "For countries like Singapore, they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation.",
  "395": " However, every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disabled, such as providing medical subsidies and building special schools to educate them.",
  "396": "Without increasing the number of disabled in a nation, the government is able to concentrate on developing other ways, such as the military and education.",
  "397": "As citizens of a nation, they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways.",
  "398": "Moreover, in the world we are living today, many miscarriages occur in hospitals every day.",
  "399": "It is easier for people to accept it morally.",
  "400": "Therefore, I believe that parents have a right to know about the health of their child.",
  "401": "Many people may support a theory that every person has the right to enjoy the world, especially those with religions.",
  "402": "However, the problem is, will people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at the hospital every day and endure all the needles and endless pain?",
  "403": "Parents know what is best for their children, thus they will make the right decision after they are informed.",
  "404": "Also, human beings should improve the medical field in order to prevent tragedies from happening.",
  "405": "I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their relatives.",
  "406": "Genetic testing is a personal choice.",
  "407": "One should have full control of their information and it is their right to decide whether or not to disclose it to someone else.",
  "408": "As far as I am concerned, when a couple is going to have babies, they are going to run a few tests to see whether either of them might have some genetic diseases.",
  "409": "The results are disclosed to husbands and wives.",
  "410": " This is not the case I am talking about here.",
  "411": "The most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases.",
  "412": "They have the right to know whether they are at risk.",
  "413": "Also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing. (Corrected for punctuation and added comma where appropriate for clarity)",
  "414": "They can take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease.",
  "415": "If a person has a disease C that might be a result of gene A, then they may have an increased risk of developing the disease.",
  "416": "He runs a test and knows that he has the gene AA.",
  "417": " This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and knows that he has the gene Aa, then he needs to go through further testing to determine if he is under high risk of having disease C.",
  "418": "This means one of his parents has gene A, and one cost of testing could be saved.",
  "419": "His relatives can then take measures if this disease can somehow be prevented to stop this disease from taking their lives.",
  "420": " Additionally, this can also be achieved through personal choice.",
  "421": "One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk.",
  "422": "Most people care about their relatives. If there are no serious consequences, I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful.",
  "423": "One might also choose to hint or encourage their certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that come across when they disclose their genetic results.",
  "424": "There are possible negative consequences that those might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relative.",
  "425": "If a person is obliged to tell his/her relatives, he or she might be discriminated against by those who do not carry this gene.",
  "426": "He or she might even be advised not to get married or have children.",
  "427": "For example, if an unmarried person has genes AA and gene AA is sufficient for a very serious disease.",
  "428": "After he took the test and was obligated to tell his relatives, everyone knew that he was a carrier.",
  "429": "So, all the married couples go for a test to know whether they are carriers. They might subconsciously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will also carry this gene.",
  "430": "It is difficult to define relatives.",
  "431": "If a gene runs in the family, one of the family members tests positive, whom does he need to tell?",
  "432": "If that is a big family, is he obliged to tell everyone?",
  "433": " Spouses usually have very close relationships. If person A tells his family that he has this gene, his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needed to run a test because his cousin has this disease.",
  "434": "However, my wife is not even at risk of having this disease.",
  "435": "Then wife D might tell her mother, who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre.",
  "436": "In less than a week, half the town knows that person A has a rare gene, and his family might be a genetically predisposed family.",
  "437": "Then nobody wants to marry him or his relatives.",
  "438": "This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of his/her information, especially when the party that he is obligated to disclose his information to is a potentially large group (relatives).",
  "439": "In conclusion, a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about their risk status.",
  "440": "Carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform their relatives.",
  "441": "Nowadays, people not only pursue the comfort of their own lives but also a better development of their following generations.",
  "442": "Since modern society's technology has advanced so much, it has become possible for people to take genetic tests to determine whether they carry a genetic risk that could affect their offspring.",
  "443": "The debatable question, an ethical dilemma, is: Is it the responsibility of people to tell their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk?",
  "444": "In my opinion, the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite evident.",
  "445": " And there are two basic reasons.",
  "446": " Input sentence: The first one is the importance of being responsible for your own self-wellness and the health of your relatives, and the second one is being responsible for the next generations.",
  "447": "The awareness of your relatives and families about your genetic risk is good for your self-wellness and the health of your relatives.",
  "448": "Because if you are carrying that genetic risk, then there is a great possibility that your relatives, like parents or siblings, are also carrying the same genetic risk as well.",
  "449": "The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger.",
  "450": "If you have not undergone genetic testing, it's just odd and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives.",
  "451": "However, if you have undergone and known that you are a carrier, you are responsible for your whole family.",
  "452": "Even though you cannot eliminate the risk completely, you can at least try to be alert to avoid getting the disease.",
  "453": "As for those in your family who may be more affected, they should go to the hospital for regular checks.",
  "454": "Therefore , informing the families and relatives about the need to prepare for fighting the disease and prevent it is your responsibility.",
  "455": "Furthermore, you are also being responsible for your next generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk.",
  "456": "If your wife is not aware of the truth and has a child without knowing it is a carrier of the same genetic risk, it will be possible for your own child to inherit that risk as well.",
  "457": " Being a parent, you are not responsible for the next generations, since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generation and being aware of it.",
  "458": " However , if you tell the truth to your wife and family, you offer a chance about whether to have a child or not.",
  "459": " And if you decide to have a baby, since technology has been so advanced, it might be possible in the future that the application of altering genes is perfected and widely used, and you can then choose to give birth to babies who have a brighter future.",
  "460": "This is a responsibility of being a parent.",
  "461": "And, in my opinion, this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing genetic testing in the first place.",
  "462": " As a conclusion, once you have undergone genetic testing and are aware of carrying specific genetic risks, there are responsibilities to your relatives, yourself, and your following generations to inform your relatives and families about the truth.",
  "463": "To tell or not to tell.",
  "464": "Consider a case, we decide to undergo genetic testing and have come to know the result of it.",
  "465": "We found that we actually are the genetic risk carriers.",
  "466": "Then, it becomes troublesome whether we should tell our relatives who may also carry this genetic risk.",
  "467": " There are really a lot of things that we need to consider.",
  "468": "Every choice we make may have a huge impact on our whole life.",
  "469": "As a result, what should we do?",
  "470": "Tell them or keep this secret until - correctly punctuated.",
  "471": " Many people feel that we should tell our relatives about their health status because we really care about them.",
  "472": "For example, diabetes is a kind of genetic disease.",
  "473": "Once we found we were carrying this genetic risk, it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well.",
  "474": "If we tell them, they may start paying more attention to their daily habits, such as eating less sugary foods and maintaining a good mood.",
  "475": "And it is important for those young people to take care of their health, their education and their future.",
  "476": "The earlier we tell them, the better habits they will form and be better for the rest of their lives.",
  "477": "What's more, they may undergo genetic tests as well to see whether they are carrying it or not which is also better for them.",
  "478": "However , some people may argue that why we want to interfere with their lives?",
  "479": "Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news, especially if they are going to know that they or their descendants may have a severe disease like a blood disease, which is untreatable.",
  "480": "You are going to feel a range of emotions, including fear, uncertainty, and anxiety.",
  "481": "It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day.",
  "482": "We become so anxious that we cannot focus on everything.",
  "483": " At the same time, there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct, which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing, so actually we are bringing trouble to them.",
  "484": "Personally, I feel that we still should take our responsibility to inform them of the situation.",
  "485": "Since this will really affect their lives, what we should do is try to make it in a positive way.",
  "486": "We cannot let it go.",
  "487": " We should know that although we may affect their lives, we can still let them make correct choices in the future.",
  "488": "It is only after they tell us will they start paying attention to their health.",
  "489": "They will consider whether to give birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem, and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby from inheriting this genetic risk as well.",
  "490": " They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not.",
  "491": "Maybe after we tell them, they will go for it and know more about themselves.",
  "492": "I know it will have a huge impact on them, but we should remember that they are our loved ones, we need to tell them about it and help them through it.",
  "493": "A genetic risk carrier should be obliged to tell.",
  "494": " Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease.",
  "495": "Once the test is done, whether the results should be open to the candidate's relatives has caused extensive controversy in society.",
  "496": "Some say it is a violation of privacy for the carrier and should be protected.",
  "497": "He or she has the right not to tell anyone.",
  "498": "However, in my opinion, it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell their relatives about their actual situation.",
  "499": "This essay will illustrate in two aspects.",
  "500": "First of all, it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have.",
  "501": "As we all know, genetic risk carriers are likely to pass their genetics to their family members.",
  "502": "Once one person in the family is found to be carrying risky genetic mutations, other members in his or her family may also have the risk of developing the disease.",
  "503": "Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough.",
  "504": "Therefore, telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment.",
  "505": "Sometimes life may even be saved if they are told early and conduct timely treatment.",
  "506": "For the consideration of other family members, the relatives should be informed.",
  "507": "Secondly, it can avoid passing genetic diseases to the next generation when they intend to have babies.",
  "508": "They should let their spouse know about their situation before marriage.",
  "509": "They need to ask for a doctor's advice before they plan to have a baby.",
  "510": "Some genetic genes will be passed only to boys rather than girls, as some are on the contrary.",
  "511": "If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to their spouse, another life may have a higher risk of inheriting the genetic disease.",
  "512": "I noticed a real story in the newspaper years ago.",
  "513": "A couple in China has a son who is 5 years old.",
  "514": "Their son unfortunately fell ill and was diagnosed with a serious genetic disease.",
  "515": "They were told that the wife's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder and can pass it only to boys rather than girls.",
  "516": " Therefore, their son inherited the genetic disease.",
  "517": "I see no grammatical errors in the given sentence.",
  "518": "The son died after one year of treatment and the couple got divorced later after that.",
  "519": "If the wife had not hindered the truth and asked for a doctor's advice before they had the baby, the tragic accident would not have happened.",
  "520": "In a nutshell, a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to inform his or her relatives about it.",
  "521": "On the one hand, it can inform members of the carrier's family about possible diseases they may have and can provide timely treatment if necessary.",
  "522": " On the other hand, it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth.",
  "523": "Nowadays, with the advancements in technology, it is easy to undergo genetic testing.",
  "524": "We cannot deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem.",
  "525": "However, I thought that genetic information is one person's personal privacy, which should be protected by the law.",
  "526": " Therefore, I thought a person who has a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their family or relatives about it.",
  "527": " There are three reasons, as follows.",
  "528": " Firstly, the information concerning genetic data is something personal that is also a privacy like a person's bank card key.",
  "529": "Other people should not be told without the person's permission, even though they are his or her family or relatives",
  "530": "The government should set laws to protect this kind of privacy.",
  "531": "Once a person's genetic information is disclosed to other people.",
  "532": "They may know the person's potential disability or other bad things naturally.",
  "533": "They may set a bias on this person, even abandoning their identity.",
  "534": "People do not have the ability to choose their genes; they should not be judged negatively because of bad genes.",
  "535": " So, I think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene matches with their parents , it should not be told to anyone, even their family or relatives.",
  "536": "Secondly, the presence of a known genetic risk may break the peace of a family and strain the relationship between children and adults.",
  "537": "Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have a relationship with them.",
  "538": "However, happy they were before, there would be some barrier that would truly destroy the family gradually.",
  "539": "The relationship between parents and children should not be tested only in a genetic way; it is something much deeper and tighter.",
  "540": "The parents give knowledge and love to the children, meanwhile they feel happy with the company of the children.",
  "541": "The children rely on the parent to live.",
  "542": "When they grow up, they will take care of their old parents and thank them for their dedication.",
  "543": "The relationship between parents and children is something about love and dedication.",
  "544": "Everyone wants to avoid the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk.",
  "545": " Therefore, I think that a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person's permission.",
  "546": " Finally, the technology of testing the gene is not yet fully mature.",
  "547": "There also exists some probability of wrong testing.",
  "548": "If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor, the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole lives.",
  "549": "Therefore, I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their family or relatives.",
  "550": "Also, considering the people's privacy and the existence of wrong testing, for the peace of the family, I support that a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their family or relatives without their permission.",
  "551": "A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their relatives.",
  "552": "More and more illnesses are being discovered to be related to specific genes with the development of medical technology.",
  "553": "People will know whether they carry a disease on their genes after they have done a genetic test.",
  "554": "If there is no problem, that will be wonderful.",
  "555": "However, not everyone is so lucky that they can ensure they do not carry any disease genes.",
  "556": "Therefore , once people find that they have carried the disease genes , they should be responsible to tell their relatives , at least their family members.",
  "557": "Awkward and embarrassed, it may be for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk.",
  "558": "But they are all from the same family and own the same ancestor, thus they own the same genes in some part.",
  "559": " Therefore, there is nothing to be shy or afraid of.",
  "560": "If the person tells their relatives that they carry a disease gene, their relatives can go to the hospital to get checked whether they also carry a disease gene.",
  "561": "Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease from occurring.",
  "562": " Also, they can prevent the disease from passing to their offspring.",
  "563": "If the relatives carry that disease gene, they can share the experience with him or her and give some help, and they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue.",
  "564": "If he or she does not get married, he or she must tell his or her partner that he or she carries a disease gene.",
  "565": "They can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors after implementing the necessary precautions.",
  "566": "Or else, if he holds back the genetic risk, they may have an unhealthy baby, and as a result, you may end up causing the death of the baby or the end of their marriage.",
  "567": "There is a story that I watched on TV.",
  "568": "A couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time. Their parents were anxious about that, and asked them to go to the hospital to check what was the problem.",
  "569": "After he came back from the hospital, the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene, so they could not have a baby in their lifetime.",
  "570": "The woman did not know the test result, but she overheard the talk and decided to divorce her husband.",
  "571": "After getting the divorce certificate, the man showed her the test report; it wrote that the woman carried the disease gene, instead of the man.",
  "572": "At that time, the woman knew how much her husband loved her, but she ruined her happiness.",
  "573": "Tears showed nothing. (the sentence is grammatically correct as it is)",
  "574": "People cannot avoid carrying the disease genes, which they are born with.",
  "575": "However, they can avoid inheriting disease genes to their children by practicing proper genetic screening techniques.",
  "576": "By telling their family members that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene, it can make them bond closely, also many risks and conflicts can be avoided.",
  "577": "Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder.",
  "578": " There arises a family-related ethical dilemma if it is right to tell a carrier's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known.",
  "579": "I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the right to know the result.",
  "580": "The answer is simply that everyone, especially our family, has the right to know the truth.",
  "581": "Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results, while the potential negative impacts of these risks still exist, the consequences will be significant if other members of their family do not know.",
  "582": "Then, they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and make emotional preparations.",
  "583": "Taking Angelina Jolie for example, she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of her breast cancer risk.",
  "584": "Everything is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope.",
  "585": "People may feel angry, depressed, or even guilty about their results.",
  "586": " In some cases, a carrier can suffer tension within a family because the results are somehow related to the others' risk.",
  "587": "However , I believe it is just a typical reaction to this situation.",
  "588": "In addition, though it can be possible in some cases that he or she and the family can undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life, how people can face more dramatic tragedy such as sickness or death if they can't even overcome this harsh situation.",
  "589": "Life is hard, but people cannot blame it on being unfair.",
  "590": "It's only because you don't become strong enough to overcome the hard times.",
  "591": "Furthermore, living with a secret is not a good sensation, especially if the situations of other family members become worse",
  "592": "Moreover, the truth cannot be hidden forever, but when it is revealed, it will be even more shocking and upsetting.",
  "593": "As a result, it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives to disclose the genetic testing results.",
  "594": "Last but not least, though genetic testing is a personal matter, discussing the results with family can improve and develop understanding and empathy among each other as well as promote awareness of taking care of everyone's health.",
  "595": "That plays an important role",
  "596": "To put it in the nutshell, I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing results for the good of their health.",
  "597": "It can be very difficult for them (as it is necessary for airline carriers and their families)",
  "598": "In addition to emotional preparations and the way you explain your genetic condition, it is also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives and, if necessary, guide them if they wish to conduct similar genetic testing.",
  "599": " The impact of social media",
  "600": " Social media has been playing a vital role in our lives today.",
  "601": "It is almost impossible for us to keep away from it.",
  "602": "I started involving in Facebook one year ago, when I just arrived in Singapore.",
  "603": "And now I have over 500 friends on Facebook and bury myself with hundreds of seeds every day.",
  "604": "We know each other's status, changes, and so on through social media.",
  "605": "For an example, if we change our contact numbers, we will no longer send SMS to each individual any longer.",
  "606": " Instead of memorizing, we will plant a seed and tag our friends to inform such changes.",
  "607": "And if you are not on it, you will just get lost.",
  "608": "In certain aspects, social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience.",
  "609": "It is becoming even more convenient than talking through the phone since it is free.",
  "610": "We discuss everything we like and have more personal space. Our friends also got more access to know what we're doing and what we like.",
  "611": " And also, we get a chance to talk to public figures like popular stars and learn more about their lives.",
  "612": "In China, many government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people, such as firefighters, police stations, and so on.",
  "613": "Social media allows them to explain or inform people what is going on.",
  "614": "And actually, lots of rescue jobs are done with the help of social media, like searching for people who are lost and so on.",
  "615": " With more convenient and humane communications, the relationship between government and people is greatly improved.",
  "616": "What's more, various cultures can be shown to us through social media.",
  "617": "We can know more news and cultures through social media.",
  "618": "From this scope, social media has shortened our distance.",
  "619": " However, we get less chance and less importance to talk face to face since social media is so convenient, advanced, and interesting.",
  "620": "And even though we gather together more people often find themselves with fewer topics to talk about and choose to retreat to their social media again.",
  "621": "When we are far away, social media makes it seem as though we're in front of each other; sometimes, when we're by each other's side, we're seen to be further than far away.",
  "622": "This kind of feeling makes people's relationships less stable, secure, and reliable than before.",
  "623": "Besides, there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or traveling experiences.",
  "624": "To some extent, this makes our life more luxurious and comfortable.",
  "625": "For myself, I am long to some places after I saw those beautiful pictures taken by my friends.",
  "626": "Sometimes I can't sleep well because of excitement.",
  "627": "Social media makes our lives patterned so fast and leaves us less time to think about our lives.",
  "628": "Social media is becoming more important, and we need to think more about how to use it effectively and improve it continually.",
  "629": "Interpersonal skills require practice as any other skills do.",
  "630": "Besides, these skills require time to develop and adapt.",
  "631": "The burgeoning of social media definitely has its drawbacks; but amongst all good things, it is better to have them in moderation.",
  "632": "Convenience and efficiency are two very important uses of social media.",
  "633": "While millions of users are connected at any one time, any information can be readily available at their perusal.",
  "634": "This improves the connectivity between users.",
  "635": "For example, one is able to send notifications and other information that we used to have them in hardcopy previously, over the web, and the process takes seconds.",
  "636": "The recipient will then receive the information almost immediately, depending on the quality of the network.",
  "637": "This convenience can be perceived as almost real-time.",
  "638": "Next, communication is also greatly improved.",
  "639": " In the past, vast communication was done by one of the many such as telegram, snail mail, and poor-quality voice calls.",
  "640": " With the welcoming of applications such as Skype and Facetime, any individual can phase off most of the outdated communication methods.",
  "641": " Apart from hearing the voice, a webcam could also be attached to simulate a 'real' interaction with expressions and gestures.",
  "642": "Communication would have taken a different turn without the easily available social media platforms.",
  "643": " However, it is a good practice not to intensively use social media all the time.",
  "644": " Intimate interaction greatly lacks in social media interactions, particularly the touch.",
  "645": "Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recipient.",
  "646": "It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utilizes the motor, thinking, and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate.",
  "647": "Unlike the use of social media, most of the interaction is done through thinking and typing.",
  "648": "As a result, one does not necessarily train the parts of the skills required for proper interpersonal relations.",
  "649": "It is also entirely incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skills.",
  "650": "Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences among people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skill on its own - some have it, some do not.",
  "651": "Howard Garner mentioned that different intelligences can be charted, according to utilizing tests, and ranked.",
  "652": "Fundamentally, those who scored lower on interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed.",
  "653": " Though social media does not necessarily have to be bad, it must be used",
  "654": "The types of use must also be taken into account - informing, interacting, discussing, and others.",
  "655": "The space of separation between the parties must also be looked at.",
  "656": "For people living very far apart, the intense use of social media is justified.",
  "657": "For those who live within the community, it is important to communicate with each other in person, not relying solely on social media as the primary source of communication.",
  "658": "And at the same time, through dynamic practices between individuals and real-time presence, improves interpersonal skills.",
  "659": "The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting.",
  "660": " Recently , the rise of social media has helped people to have a more convenient and cost-effective way to maintain online contact with each other compared to face-to-face meetings. This is where it becomes increasingly popular. Recall the difference compared to some men's permission to treat any 2,3,4 people, and you will see that it's relatively easy.",
  "661": "In my opinion, social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face-to-face contact and thus negatively affect interpersonal skills.",
  "662": "On the other hand, it may even increase the chance of having face-to-face contacts among people.",
  "663": "First , social media networks have a large user base, it helps to link people from different parts of the world.",
  "664": " In the days without social networks, people may not have had the chance to know others from different countries or meet new people before.",
  "665": "Their number of people they know may only be limited to the people they meet in daily life like classmates and working partners.",
  "666": "Therefore, social networks bring more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never knew before, and this helps to develop the interpersonal skills as well.",
  "667": "Secondly, although social networks can take time for people to chat online but not face to face, they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in their daily lives",
  "668": " In this case, the social network helps people increase the frequency of communication.",
  "669": "For example, if social networks did not exist, business people would have to meet each other face-to-face, which is time-consuming, even for businesses that are not significant, it still takes a lot of time on travel, which is a waste.",
  "670": "However , social networks help people to meet and chat much easier. They can even use video chat and create group chats to chat with multiple parties at the same time.",
  "671": "Nowadays, even some companies conduct online video interviews with their applicants as it saves time and costs.",
  "672": "The social network may also create some negative impacts for the people.",
  "673": "The largest negative impact is that due to the online network, some people start to use and rely on the internet every minute.",
  "674": "They spend too much time on online social networks and thus do not have time for their real-life meetings.",
  "675": "It not only affects interpersonal skills but also adversely affects people's health if they spend too much time on social media.",
  "676": "Secondly, social network may leak certain personal informations to the public as the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe, people may not protect their privacy online effectively and sometimes, some people may use others' personal information to deceive.",
  "677": "In conclusion, although the unsafe online environment and spending too much time on the internet may be potential negative factors of using online social networks.",
  "678": " It provides people with a more convenient contact environment and improves the frequency of meeting with each other.",
  "679": "It also helps people develop their interpersonal skills through online chatting.",
  "680": " Overall, there are more benefits than costs.",
  "681": "The world is increasingly becoming flat by all kinds of social network websites such as Facebook and Twitter.",
  "682": "We can even know what a friend who left thousands of miles away eats for lunch through these kinds of social media.",
  "683": "From some points of view, social media really has a lot of advantages because it allows us to communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently.",
  "684": "However, its disadvantages cannot be ignored when considering it as a platform for showcasing and a stage for cyber crime.",
  "685": "Social network sites provide us many conveniences.",
  "686": "Without hanging out with friends or talking to friends through phone, we can know his/her latest news by scanning the webpage.",
  "687": "It can help us better understand each other.",
  "688": "It can make people become closer as well.",
  "689": "For example, if you find out one of your friend's favorite singer is Justin Bieber through Facebook, you can give them Justin Bieber's new album or a concert ticket as a birthday gift.",
  "690": "It will be really sweet, and you two will surely become closer.",
  "691": "In addition, social network sites can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away.",
  "692": "I met some Canadian friends in Egypt.",
  "693": "Without Facebook, we may lose contact.",
  "694": " However, thanks to Facebook, I can still keep in touch with them, and I know what they are doing recently, as we live close to each other.",
  "695": "The disadvantages of social network media are quite undeniable.",
  "696": "A research shows that people will unconsciously hide their real thoughts when they say or post something that will be exposed to the public, due to the fear of judgment and social stigma.",
  "697": "It means that one cannot know another's real thoughts and personalities by reading things that he or she posts on social network media.",
  "698": "It will make them quite upset when they communicate in real life.",
  "699": " In addition, with all those \" nice \" guys around on social network websites, one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on Facebook.",
  "700": "It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other but just look at their cellphones.",
  "701": "This kind of behavior is not good for people's psychological health, according to research.",
  "702": "The cyber communication is quite different from face-to-face communication, and people who depend on cyber communication too much may not get used to real-life communication.",
  "703": "In addition, cyber relationships may not always work in real life.",
  "704": " With no close relationships in real life but only close cyber friends, one may actually feel more lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel a bond with others through our five senses.",
  "705": "With the willingness of people to become the best among others, social network sites now have become a place to show off.",
  "706": "Some people will post their expensive things or the overseas places they've been on social media and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so.",
  "707": "It is a mental health issue that may trigger people, especially teenagers, to become materialistic.",
  "708": "Lastly, with all kinds of personal information on one's social network page, it is convenient for criminals to use this information to commit crimes.",
  "709": " Above all, social media sites can be like a double-edged sword, and people can only fully take advantage of them by avoiding the possible disadvantages of them such as not putting too much personal information on their Facebook pages.",
  "710": "The modes of communication have been changing over the years, from letter writing to social networking.",
  "711": "This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology, which has made communication to be faster than ever before.",
  "712": " Today, social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are relatively common within contemporary society, and people can communicate with each other, online or offline, on these social networking platforms.",
  "713": "They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms, which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world.",
  "714": " However, critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites, people may prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends.",
  "715": "This essay will discuss both the benefits and downsides of using social media in contemporary society.",
  "716": " Nowadays, social media is able to disseminate information faster than any other medium.",
  "717": "About 50% of the people have learned about breaking news from social media.",
  "718": " This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than reading newspapers.",
  "719": "Furthermore, with the current technology, smartphones have made it easier for consumers to access social media sites and stay connected with their friends and family.",
  "720": "Hence, social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information instantly to the people around them.",
  "721": " However, critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated are reliable.",
  "722": "There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media.",
  "723": " For example, in 2012, there were false rumors of fires, shootouts, and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb that spread through Twitter and Facebook.",
  "724": " This had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls, resulting in the temporary closure of schools.",
  "725": "The spread of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone, given that social media can disseminate information so quickly.",
  "726": " However, there are cyber police who monitor these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes from spreading around.",
  "727": " But, despite high security to control almost every social networking movement, there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites.",
  "728": "Social media has the ability to improve relationships and make new friends, provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties.",
  "729": "Many teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media, regardless of their location.",
  "730": "In the past, people used to writing letters to their friends, and it would take relatively long time to send the letter over.",
  "731": " Therefore, with the help of technology, people are able to catch up with each other conveniently.",
  "732": "Furthermore, it will be easier to find new friends who have similar interests or hobbies.",
  "733": "However, for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends and it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties.",
  "734": " It might not be accurate to judge the other party's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media.",
  "735": " In addition, there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they cannot sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms.",
  "736": "This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties due to miscommunication.",
  "737": " But, if there is trust and mutual understanding on social media, it will be ideal for people to improve relationships and make new friends.",
  "738": "In conclusion, social media in contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships, make new friends, and disseminate information efficiently to the masses.",
  "739": " However, there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication.",
  "740": "Nevertheless, the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully managed.",
  "741": "All in all, social media is the product of rapid technological advancement, and there will be even more to come in the future.",
  "742": "Advantages: Social media sites have greatly eased long-distance communication and interaction due to their accessibility and convenience.",
  "743": " With a globalized and interconnected world today, Twitter and Facebook have become the mainstream platforms for social interaction.",
  "744": " With just a touch away from any media/electronic devices, one can easily interact and communicate with friends without much hassle.",
  "745": "Thus, long-distance relationships or friendships can be maintained, and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has become much easier.",
  "746": " With the sharing of personal photos and posting of one's personal feelings or experiences, people are able to engage and expand their human interaction with ease.",
  "747": "Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platforms.",
  "748": "Thus, socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms. Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another, making human interaction possible at one's own convenience.",
  "749": "The society will adapt to such phenomena as physical interaction is transformed into cyber interaction.",
  "750": " With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet, a society that socializes through cyber will be more advanced and adapted to the highly connected world.",
  "751": "This will greatly help a society progress rapidly.",
  "752": "Disadvantages: One of the main concerns of using social media platforms to communicate is credibility.",
  "753": "The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits physical interaction unless using a webcam to chat.",
  "754": "We cannot be certain for sure about the reliability or truth of some posts or information we received through the internet.",
  "755": "We may in actual fact be communicating with a hoax Facebook account of a cyber friend, which we assume to be real but in reality, it is a fake account.",
  "756": "Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit certain personal agendas.",
  "757": "Thus, the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through, media.",
  "758": "Although emojis can convey certain emotions, this is different from the real authentic emotions of your friends that you observe through their body language and facial expressions.",
  "759": "The danger of social media is the uncertainty of communication due to lack of physical interaction.",
  "760": " Furthermore, this lack of physical interaction has affected human interpersonal behavior since communication is now made through social media instead of meet-ups.",
  "761": " This decreases the experience of human ability to interact with one another, which can adversely shape one's behavior.",
  "762": "The lack of exposure to real-life interaction with humans cannot create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others.",
  "763": "Therefore, for an effective and efficient society, there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction within its people.",
  "764": "Nowadays, people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world.",
  "765": "People use Twitter to follow their favorite artist or celebrity and Facebook to see what their friends' recent activity is.",
  "766": " Nevertheless, they still can use their phone to make normal calls and send messages to contact people.",
  "767": "Not only the phone did the jobs for them, but also devices like personal computers, laptops, tablets, and many other devices that are able to connect to the internet.",
  "768": "It is obvious to see that the internet saves people's time and also connects people globally.",
  "769": "Several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually having some inevitable disadvantages to people.",
  "770": "People can only use electrical devices to access the internet.",
  "771": "Whenever they need to use social media, they have to use a phone or internet connection.",
  "772": " Generally, people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and their fingers to manipulate the corresponding device.",
  "773": " As a result, they will lose eye contact and the ability to express their feelings to people nearby them, which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face communication.",
  "774": "This can easily be seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays.",
  "775": "A family of four having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork.",
  "776": "A group of friends is having high tea in a caf\u00e9 but they are not chatting because they do not know what to talk about, but instead they are pressing on their display screens.",
  "777": "The children nowadays do not know what neighborhood games are and who is staying beside them; all they know is pressing icons on screens.",
  "778": "These are some concrete examples of how social media reduce face-to-face human contact.",
  "779": "When people use social media to contact other people, what will happen is that their interpersonal communication skills will degrade and eventually be lost.",
  "780": "Firstly, they have lost the courage to meet strangers and not even the courage to talk.",
  "781": "Also, they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills.",
  "782": " As a result, social media helps them do the job but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills.",
  "783": "Social media has some other advantages besides their general benefits to humanity.",
  "784": "People save money by using the internet to communicate with others and read news.",
  "785": "A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in another country via social media software instead of making an international call, which can cost a lot and be unaffordable for a normal salary family.",
  "786": "He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using a video call via the internet.",
  "787": "Secondly, people make friends all over the world and are able to easily update their friends on their recent activity.",
  "788": "A guy who is going to travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity.",
  "789": "When one of his friends, who is not aware of this, has failed to contact him via telephone calls, he might be able to get his whereabouts using social media.",
  "790": "These are the advantages that save most of the time.",
  "791": "In conclusion, social media benefits people in several ways but also harms them.",
  "792": " People should avoid the misuse of social media and use it properly.",
  "793": "With the aid of social media, people connect globally, information flows rapidly, and human lives are improved.",
  "794": "All of us are living in a technology-based society",
  "795": "Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people?",
  "796": " It started with the invention of technology, which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades.",
  "797": "In the past, we traveled by ship and now we can use airplanes to do so.",
  "798": "In the past, it took a few days to receive a letter because we needed to mail it. Now, we can use email (short for electronic message), our handphone, or various messaging apps to send messages to our friends.",
  "799": "From the example that I mentioned earlier, we can see that the distance between us and our loved ones is gradually increasing.",
  "800": " This is because by the ease of technology such as airplanes, some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life.",
  "801": "Thus, this makes Twitter and Facebook one of the media that we need.",
  "802": " Nevertheless, everything in life has positive and negative effects.",
  "803": "This applies to all these social media sites.",
  "804": "The next two paragraphs will be discussing the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society.",
  "805": "With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends, even though we are away from them.",
  "806": "Social media sites such as Facebook allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas.",
  "807": "This app helps parents communicate with their children and know what kind of activities their children have when they are overseas.",
  "808": "The social media is beneficial as it connects you and your loved ones even though you are separated by distance.",
  "809": " It might not be able to replace the joy of being with your family, but it could help reduce the sadness of being away from them.",
  "810": "As I mentioned in the beginning, there are also disadvantages to social media tools.",
  "811": "One of them is that it reduces the level of concentration, especially among the youngsters.",
  "812": "This is because it is part of everyone's habit to check their Facebook page as their friends will post something new every second.",
  "813": "Thus, you can see that some students will browse Facebook while attending lectures.",
  "814": "This means that the students are not concentrating when they are supposed to do so.",
  "815": "As a result, it could affect their lives and their studies.",
  "816": "This could lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted.",
  "817": "In my opinion, every individual has to take responsibility for their own lives by making the right decisions.",
  "818": "Advantages and disadvantages in using social media platforms exist, however, in this case, striking a balance between using social media and maintaining a healthy personal life is the most important thing to do.",
  "819": "Nowadays, the use of social media platforms is a commonplace in our lives.",
  "820": "In this increasingly globalized world, such platforms even enhance and complicate the links between individuals around the world.",
  "821": "Thanks to them, people can get to know one another online without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons.",
  "822": "However, the increasing use of virtual worlds is also bringing some social changes and has some negative impacts on individual's daily lives, which makes it a large problem in societies as a whole.",
  "823": "As people spend more and more time on such social media sites, the importance of face-to-face human contacts decreases.",
  "824": " As people feel more confident online, where they do not have to face real-life situations on the spot, they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online.",
  "825": "This results in a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals, especially young students as they always have the option to turn their backs on real-life and go online.",
  "826": "This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life.",
  "827": " As they are so used to having an online avatar, they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realize how to interact with people in real life.",
  "828": " Another problem with social media is that, the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy are not reflected as something positive to the users.",
  "829": "The reason why it is so addictive is that the more people get into social media, the more they seek attention from their friends.",
  "830": "However, such sudden bursts of attention are extremely short-term and gone easily, thus they do not add any value or meaning to the user's life.",
  "831": " Also, according to a research, it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook because they unknowingly compare their lives with other people's lives.",
  "832": "But seriously, most people only post the happiest moments in their lives.",
  "833": "Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that keep the users connected among the people.",
  "834": "Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friends' contacts that I want to keep.",
  "835": "However, the friendships in a virtual world are often superficial, which is not as relevant to real-life true friendships.",
  "836": "Also, as numerous profit-driven companies realize the huge human traffic on such social media sites, they make it a prime target to fish customers by uploading many advertisements.",
  "837": "Furthermore, this scenario should be taken into account as it also possibly triggers privacy issues since Facebook allows profit-driven companies to have access to user information.",
  "838": "As this happens, users are becoming increasingly prone to any possible frauds.",
  "839": " Social media sites are at their peaks right now, however, I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better people in real life, they will not be so engaged in them as much as they are now.",
  "840": "The users will soon realize that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with their friends because, if they really need someone, they will reach their friends no matter what.",
  "841": " We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media, but do we really connect or fall apart?",
  "842": "Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter were born with the intention of connecting people from around the world.",
  "843": "The idea seems great, and nowadays most people, even older generations, will have at least one social media platform like Facebook.",
  "844": "The parents are now the \"friends\" of their kids, and they can now \"follow\" their kids more closely and in real-time.",
  "845": "People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently, to be connected with their so-called friends.",
  "846": " Additionally, as we may tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced face-to-face human contact, it eventually affects our interpersonal skills.",
  "847": "First and foremost , I would like to share on the advantages of using social media in my daily life.",
  "848": "As a student, I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and at different settings.",
  "849": "We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as Facebook accounts in order to stay in touch.",
  "850": "Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call, social media like Facebook is a great way for friends from different fields or even from different parts of the world to connect.",
  "851": "Within clicks, we could check on our friend's profile and read their updates.",
  "852": "On the other hand, we could update our profile by posting on the wall, and our friends could read the updates on the newsfeed.",
  "853": "This allows friends who may not have the time for meetups to still stay connected in a way.",
  "854": " Not only that, new friends can easily be met through such online platforms.",
  "855": "Hence, our social circle is indeed expanding.",
  "856": " Nonetheless, what seems to make us connected can also be the cause that falls us apart.",
  "857": "The obvious disadvantage of using social media is that the reduction in face-to-face contact can make it harder to develop relationships and maintain connections.",
  "858": "This subsequently leads to poor interpersonal skills, which inhibits the growth of our real social circle.",
  "859": " For example, we tend to send birthday wishes when Facebook prompts us \"Today is someone's birthday.\"",
  "860": "In fact, we may have just forgotten our friend's birthday.",
  "861": "We used to send wishes cards during festive season like Chinese New Year , and we feel so good to write them and receive them with stamps on them.",
  "862": "Gone were the times when people sent handwritten cards and letters, and now we have mass-send online wishes which can be less meaningful to the receiver.",
  "863": "As time passed, we may have more friends on the list, but the meaning of friendship needs to be redefined.",
  "864": "In a nutshell , every sword has two edges.",
  "865": "The users of every social media site need to strike a balance between the real world and the virtual one.",
  "866": "We should maximize the benefits of such platforms, but be careful of the impacts on the actual lives that we have.",
  "867": " Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings, but social media sites are only tools to help.",
  "868": "Nowadays, social media sites are commonly used in society.",
  "869": "I believe 80 percent of people play social media sites.",
  "870": "These sites play the role of connecting people around the world",
  "871": "This sentence is already grammatically correct, so no changes are needed.",
  "872": "However, there are also some disadvantages that occur due to social media that are continually being concerns in society.",
  "873": " Therefore, this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily lives.",
  "874": " First, with the function of social media sites that connect people, everyone can interact and communicate with friends, families, or even strangers without time or place constraints.",
  "875": " Through social media sites, we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand.",
  "876": "There are over thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries.",
  "877": "However, we are able to chat with our friends without traveling to different countries.",
  "878": " It saves a lot of money and time, and strengthens our relationship although we stay at different places around the world.",
  "879": " Besides that, the company can use the convenience of social media sites, such as Facebook chat or Skype, to facilitate meetings with project parties from around the world.",
  "880": "Substantial cost is saved without the tiring travel from one point to another.",
  "881": "With the huge amount of cost savings, this capital can be utilized in other sectors to benefit the company more and boost up its profit.",
  "882": " However, there are always two sides to a story.",
  "883": "Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between humans.",
  "884": " Since ancient times, humans have interacted with others face-to-face.",
  "885": "Without facial expressions, it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers.",
  "886": "That is why facial expressions are one of the most important elements in social learning.",
  "887": "In addition, \" social media sites will affect writing skills \" , that is the point of view in society.",
  "888": "Based on the statistic report, the more time spent on social media sites, the less writing skills will be developed.",
  "889": "I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know.",
  "890": "The auto-correction software is so effective when using electronic devices, but we did not realize the importance of writing until now.",
  "891": "Writing is an essential skill for anyone who wants to express their own feelings and opinions.",
  "892": "'Privacy ', this is the word that has become popular in these few decades.",
  "893": "humans have their own rights and privacy.",
  "894": "I believe that most of us agree with these terms.",
  "895": "However , there is news about social media sites leaking users' personal information to companies for cash reimbursement.",
  "896": "Everything we type in social media sites is recorded in servers and then transferred to companies for spying and advertising purposes.",
  "897": " Although it looks like there are no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want, you are actually wrong.",
  "898": "You are not only controlled by government laws but also spied on by the government as well.",
  "899": " In conclusion, everything has two sides of the story.",
  "900": "It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites.",
  "901": "To utilize technology well, we should strive to balance the pros and cons, as well as extend the pros and shorten the cons.",
  "902": "Thus, the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our and the next generation.",
  "903": " With the widespread spread of advanced technology, social media sites are becoming increasingly popular.",
  "904": "Getting connected on social media such as Facebook and Twitter has become a main trend and daily work nowadays.",
  "905": "With this situation, both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily lives.",
  "906": "On one side, it is obviously that many advantages have been brought to our lives.",
  "907": "Social media provides people with the opportunity to stay in touch with each other anytime, anywhere.",
  "908": "Whether we are at home, school, work, or on a holiday, we are able to communicate and interact with our friends.",
  "909": "Even when people are thousands of miles apart, social media makes it possible to have interaction by keeping in touch and writing comments.",
  "910": "When our phones are accidentally dropped, we can also use social media to connect with our friends.",
  "911": " Some people who are trying to talk in public can also actively take part in the group chatting on social media.",
  "912": "Besides, we can make more friends by such interactions when our friends also bring their friends in.",
  "913": "Therefore , the popularity of social media sites has made it more convenient for people to update their friends' status and stay in contact with friends more frequently.",
  "914": " On the other side, we need to rethink about the influence brought by social media.",
  "915": "There are still several disadvantages of using social media.",
  "916": "Firstly, interpersonal skills may be affected by the reduction in face-to-face human contact.",
  "917": " While social media brings convenience to people's lives, people are increasingly willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting, which has a time and place requirement.",
  "918": "People who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people, and their interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation.",
  "919": "Secondly, people's over-addiction may avoidably, to some degree, exacerbate social alienation, and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over-dependence on virtual social networking.",
  "920": "More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life.",
  "921": "This is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing with social changes to get hurt.",
  "922": "Thirdly, a lot of updating of luxury living standards as well as other show-off situations may make people's daily life more and more extravagant, which is not an accurate social growth trend.",
  "923": "Lastly, it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media.",
  "924": "Again, there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addiction, and their study and work may be greatly influenced.",
  "925": "Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media, and we cannot deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us, this main trend of using social media may continue to last for a long time.",
  "926": " Therefore, every time we use social media, we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages.",
  "927": "Also, by absorbing the essence and discarding the clutter, we can make more efficient use of social media.",
  "928": "In the sophisticated era, like these days, experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier.",
  "929": " Geographical and transportation borders are no longer a problem because communication and information technologies have been continuously enhanced.",
  "930": "Telephone may be perceived as a big innovation of its time when the first time Graham Bell introduced it.",
  "931": " However , since the internet became known, the telephone started to give way to social media sites.",
  "932": "Many advantages are given to the users.",
  "933": " Let us take examples from Facebook and Twitter, two of the most famous social media sites.",
  "934": "Through Facebook, people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances.",
  "935": " This benefit cannot be obtained through telephone or mail because people's particular and address may change from time to time while on Facebook, people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo, for example, as the identifier.",
  "936": "Facebook is like a combination of a messaging and chat service, a personal profile, a media sharing platform, and other entertainment add-ons (i.e., games, videos, etc.).",
  "937": "Social games) which allow users to communicate with remote people and also to update and express themselves at the same time.",
  "938": "Twitter, which has a more simplified function compared to Facebook, gives more benefits if used as an information sharing medium.",
  "939": "Twitter only allows users to give updates that are limited to short sentences in order to spread the words quickly; that is, only highlighted messages will be delivered.",
  "940": "For Facebook, a comprehensive way of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded, long notes can be published, even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays.",
  "941": "These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones.",
  "942": "Despite the luxuries offered by social media, there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize beforehand.",
  "943": "Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people who are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing.",
  "944": "As a consequence, it affects their interpersonal skills.",
  "945": " People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say, but in face-to-face communication, every word that comes out of your mouth, whether it is well arranged or not, is a picture of your personality.",
  "946": " This skill requires practice and cannot be completely developed through social media.",
  "947": "There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant, but everybody is busy with their own gadgets, posting pictures on Facebook, updating their status on Twitter, or even chatting with friends.",
  "948": "These social media serve a purpose to bind people despite their geographical boundaries, but it does not mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff.",
  "949": "This is related to the interpersonal skill mentioned earlier, which can decrease qualitatively if we become used to interacting with gadgets rather than human beings.",
  "950": " Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected parts of our lives, we build a \"false image\" in public.",
  "951": " We tend to only share our happy moments on media.",
  "952": "Because of this, other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problems at all.",
  "953": "Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same.",
  "954": "As a result , people may think of themselves as lowly and may lead to depression and mental disorder.",
  "955": "It also reduces our sympathy.",
  "956": " This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people.",
  "957": "As explained above, modern and sophisticated technology doesn't always give advantages.",
  "958": "There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of.",
  "959": "It is up to people's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take.",
  "960": "So, we should never forget to consider and calculate the benefits and costs of every decision that we make.",
  "961": "Nowadays, the advancement of technologies improves the lives of many people a lot.",
  "962": "In most countries, there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.",
  "963": "Many people think that social media sites have benefits on communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society.",
  "964": "One of the advantages of those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before.",
  "965": "In the past decades, when social media sites were not yet fully developed, people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone, or even a letter.",
  "966": " However , calling a person using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost , especially in villages, where sending a letter takes much time.",
  "967": "The use of social media sites is causing those problems to be solved.",
  "968": "People can connect through social media sites without spending any money, and their messages can reach them in just one or a few seconds.",
  "969": "Therefore, this advantage of social media sites saves money and time and also provides convenience for many people.",
  "970": " Moreover, this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time, such as their friends in primary school and secondary school.",
  "971": "As we graduate from a school, we will probably lose contact with some of our friends.",
  "972": " Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses, and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter.",
  "973": "If phone and letter are the only way to contact them, we probably won't be able to find them.",
  "974": " Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to connect with our old friends.",
  "975": "Hence, the social media sites serve as a platform for connection.",
  "976": "Everything comes with benefits, but also has its disadvantages.",
  "977": "On the other hand, social media sites also bring some negative impacts for the people and society.",
  "978": "The advancement of social media sites makes people so reliant on them that some of them rather prefer using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face-to-face.",
  "979": "Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought about by social media sites.",
  "980": " The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life, which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people.",
  "981": "As we all know, interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas.",
