  "0": "Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing (if the sentence is missing context or a verb, best to leave as is)",
  "1": "What is genetic risk? (assuming it is a question about the definition or explanation of the term genetic risk)",
  "2": "Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease.",
  "3": "People get certain diseases because of genetic changes.",
  "4": "How much a genetic change tells us about one's chance of developing a disorder is not always clear. (I corrected \"your\" to \"one's\" because \"your\" is ambiguous here.)",
  "5": "If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease.",
  "6": "The opposite is also true.",
  "7": "If your genetic results show that you don't have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it's still possible to develop heart disease.",
  "8": "However, for some rare diseases, people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease.",
  "9": "When we are diagnosed with certain genetic diseases, are we supposed to disclose these results to our relatives?",
  "10": "My answer is no.",
  "11": "On one hand, we do not want this potential danger to cause frightening effects in our families' later lives.",
  "12": "When people around us know that we have a certain disease, their attitudes will be easily changed, whether they care too much or keep their distance from us.",
  "13": "And neither is that what we want, since most of us just want to live normal lives.",
  "14": "Surrounded by such concerns, it is very likely that we are distracted and worried about these problems.",
  "15": "It is a concern that will be with us throughout our whole life, because we will never know when the \"potential bomb\" will explode.",
  "16": "On the other hand, if there are ways that can help us control or cure the disease, we can go through these processes from the perspective of the whole family.",
  "17": "For example, if exercise is helpful for preventing family diseases, we can always look for more opportunities for the family to exercise.",
  "18": "And we keep track of all family members' health conditions.",
  "19": "At the same time, we are prepared to know when there are other members who get this disease.",
  "20": "Here I want to share Forest's view on this issue.",
  "21": "Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings, there currently is no legal requirement for them to do so.",
  "22": "In fact, requiring someone to communicate her or his own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious.",
  "23": " I'm sorry, I need a complete and grammatically correct sentence as input in order to provide output. Please provide a grammatically correct and complete sentence.",
  "24": "Nothing is absolutely right or wrong.",
  "25": "If a certain genetic disease test is very accurate, it is unavoidable, necessary to get treatment, and known by others, then it is OK to disclose the result.",
  "26": "Above all, life is more important than secrecy.",
  "27": "Genetic risk does carry consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle. OR Genetic risks do carry consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle.",
  "28": "After all, what affects one family may or may not affect another, even if the families have a common genetic makeup, shared by either parent.",
  "29": "In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder, disclosing or not disclosing it to a relative is solely a matter of preference within the individual's moral system.",
  "30": "The issue of the right to know or not to know is highly debatable, even though it involves genetic risk. One cannot be entirely sure because genetic information could potentially come from the families of either parent, including aunts, uncles, or cousins.",
  "31": "This also means that as soon as a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile, they concurrently have knowledge about others.",
  "32": "This knowledge may be relevant to them, and vice versa.",
  "33": "An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer.",
  "34": "Unchanged: It is hereditary.",
  "35": "Do those who suffer from this disease keep it a secret or inform their relatives?",
  "36": "In retrospect, it is also one's duty to ensure that he or she undergoes periodic health checks in theirs.",
  "37": "Sometimes, family structures and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication.",
  "38": "Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from, such as a son or daughter, the parents who know about this would decide who gets told and who takes precedence in being 'allowed' to tell.",
  "39": "For example, within a family, regardless of who had first received genetic information, parents were seen as having primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring, even if they were adults at risk.",
  "40": "In addition, a woman testing positive for BRCA1 may be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than doing it herself. However, this may be further complicated by an individual's response to risk information, as they may not want to know. (I changed \"would be expected to allow\" to \"may be expected to allow\", as the latter is less certain. The rest of the sentence seems grammatically correct.)",
  "41": "Hence, there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know (such as nieces and nephews) nor persuade those with authority (the parents) to do so.",
  "42": "The notion of authority also extended \"vertically.\"",
  "43": "For example, a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt, even when she herself is not at genetic risk while the aunt is.",
  "44": "From a practitioner's perspective, these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct, they may not align with geneticists' views of family relationships or determine which blood (or non-blood) relatives should be informed and by whom; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context.",
  "45": "Ultimately, one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assist those at risk in making considered decisions about disclosure.",
  "46": "Whose duty it is to inform at-risk relatives greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how directive the risk is to them. (removed comma after \"personal moral\" and corrected the word \"at risk\" to \"at-risk\")",
  "47": "People with close blood relationships generally carry some similar genes. (I'm assuming you meant \"relationships\" instead of \"relationship\". If not, the correction would be \"People with a close blood relation generally carry some similar genes.\")",
  "48": "In this case, if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk, it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue and let others know about the risk. This way, family members can perform some daily exercises to prevent the potential disease or go to the hospital and check for the corresponding flows.",
  "49": "In my opinion, although the announcement of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self-privacy, it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease.",
  "50": "I agree with this statement to a large extent. (No changes needed, the sentence is already grammatically correct)",
  "51": "Focus on the negative side of the announcement of genetic risk first.",
  "52": "Large numbers of patients with a genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret, as the genetic risk may indicate their high chance of carrying certain diseases.",
  "53": "Especially for young, unmarried people, if they are known to have some genetic risk, there may be a certain chance that their child would carry the same disease, but it is not certain.",
  "54": "Therefore, keeping the information secret from his/her future spouse would help the relationship.",
  "55": "Secondly, announcing the potential risk could cause family members to be scared of this certain issue, even though the factor may not be that serious. People would still fear that they may have some potential disease in the future, so they might go to the hospital, do additional checks, or take more medicine to prevent the disease. This creates unnecessary costs for the family.",
  "56": "Furthermore, the announcement of genetic risk would affect relationships with relatives, as sometimes others may think they should stay away from the carrier to reduce their chance of getting the potential disease.",
  "57": "On the other hand, if the genetic risk is kept as a secret, it may benefit the carrier to a certain extent and help maintain privacy, but it has much larger negative impacts on family members and relatives.",
  "58": "First, in the case of marriage, people should be honest and tell their spouse they may carry certain genetic risks that may affect their offspring.",
  "59": "It is better to let the other party know the fact before the baby is born, if a certain type of genetic disease is found.",
  "60": "It is better for both parties to be honest.",
  "61": "Secondly, genetic diseases have a close relationship with the genes a person is born with, as well as their daily habits.",
  "62": "For example, if a carrier is told that he/she has a risk of having diabetes.",
  "63": "In this case, the carrier can eat less candy and chocolate to prevent intake of too much sugar and, at the same time, if the carrier tells this information to the relatives, it will be useful for them to know that they may have a higher risk of diabetes due to related genes, and they can perform the same exercise to reduce sugar intake and possibly prevent the disease.",
  "64": "Otherwise, if the other parties did not know, they may end up with diabetes in the future without any prevention.",
  "65": "In conclusion, we could tell that the benefits of telling genetic risk to carriers' relatives outweigh the costs.",
  "66": "Therefore, it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives. This would allow them to know and potentially prevent the disease through daily exercises.",
  "67": "Among all kinds of diseases, a large number of them are caused by genetic reasons.",
  "68": "Genetic disorders may or may not be hereditary diseases, and it is sometimes hard to find out if one has these kinds of diseases.",
  "69": "It has been a long-time topic of discussion as to whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives that the disease is caused by a gene.",
  "70": "From the legal aspect, the answer is no, but from the ethical aspect, the answer should be yes. (No changes needed)",
  "71": "We can't make a law to compel a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his/her genetic problem.",
  "72": "It is immoral and impractical. (if the context implies that a further explanation is expected, a sentence like \"to continuing to pollute the environment\" should be added)",
  "73": "Firstly, someone's health information is private.",
  "74": "Privacy protection belongs to one's human rights.",
  "75": "If a law requires someone to disclose \"his or her\" privacy, especially when the person is not willing to do so.",
  "76": "It is against his or her human rights and it is against the spirit of the law.",
  "77": "The spirit of the law also includes fairness.",
  "78": "What is the basic difference between a genetic disorder and other disorders?",
  "79": "It is unfair to release a law that targets only genetic disorders.",
  "80": "In addition, it is impractical to make such a law.",
  "81": "A good law should be clear and easy to enforce.",
  "82": "However, there are many problems against the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her relatives the cause of his or her disease.",
  "83": "Firstly, what is the range of relatives? (assuming there is a context about math or statistics)",
  "84": "For example, does the carrier only need to tell direct relatives, like parents, brothers, and sisters, or does he/she also need to tell more distant relatives, like a grandmother's sister's son's daughter's nephew?",
  "85": "If you say that you only need to tell direct relatives, it will be against the fairness of the law.",
  "86": "Other relatives may have the same possibilities of having such a disease.",
  "87": "How can a law made by the government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potential disease?",
  "88": "However, from an ethical point of view.",
  "89": "To the carrier, he or she should have a responsibility to tell his or her relatives about any genetic disorder.",
  "90": "By doing this, they may be able to save some of their relatives' lives.",
  "91": "It is because a carrier with a \"bad\" gene may not necessarily have those genetic diseases. If they can maintain a corresponding healthy lifestyle, they may be able to prevent the gene's function from becoming stronger with age.",
  "92": "A typical example is genetically caused hypertension.",
  "93": "Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems that make it harder for the body to digest fat and salt in the blood, which can lead to hypertension.",
  "94": "People usually get this kind of hypertension after they become adults.",
  "95": "However, if they already know they have a gene that may make them have a higher probability of getting hypertension.",
  "96": "They can build a daily habit of eating less salt and fat and thus avoid hypertension.",
  "97": "In a nutshell, our society can't force a genetic problem carrier to tell his or her disease to his or her relatives, but he or she should be willing to tell relatives about the genetic problem.",
  "98": "By doing so, fewer of his or her loved ones will suffer from the genetic problem.",
  "99": "In the age of rapid technological advancement, many medical breakthroughs are made possible.",
  "100": "Genetic testing is made possible and available for one's decision to undergo.",
  "101": "It is able to detect illnesses or diseases and even a child's parentage.",
  "102": "However, it will become a controversial issue, as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives.",
  "103": "If knowledge of the genetic risk were to be shared within the family or relatives, there might be a chance for them to have it in their blood, which might lead them to take necessary precautions to prevent it.",
  "104": "But if it is a terminal disease, such as a genetic disease, most relatives will be disheartened upon hearing about it.",
  "105": "Therefore, some carriers will have the opinion of keeping it a secret.",
  "106": "This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not.",
  "107": "Some say that the genetic risk found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered personal information that should be kept confidential.",
  "108": "Most patients will be depressed after realizing his or her condition.",
  "109": "If one has a genetic disease after the test, he or she might not wish to inform relatives as he or she might end up disheartening the extended family.",
  "110": "Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope not to bring in any pessimism into their family.",
  "111": "Furthermore, some will wish not to become a burden on anyone, as seeking medical attention is relatively costly.",
  "112": "Hence, some see it as being considerate to keep the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential.",
  "113": "On the other hand, others may think that it would be considerate to tell the relatives because they will have a higher tendency of having the same genetic risk.",
  "114": "Hence, they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to take some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease.",
  "115": "Nevertheless, it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases are given in the context of current medical technology.",
  "116": "For example, breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is realized in the early stage.",
  "117": " Hence, with the knowledge of having a genetic risk, relatives of this genetic disease will undergo a medical check-up, which might save them by realizing it at an earlier stage.",
  "118": "In conclusion, it would be considerate to inform relatives of the risk of getting the same genetic disease.",
  "119": "Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention, such as financial issues, everyone should have the right to know their family's inherited medical conditions.",
  "120": "However, some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it and will continue to lead happy lives.",
  "121": "In addition, some may think that even knowing about having a genetic risk of the disease will just add to their misery, as there is nothing they can do about it.",
  "122": "All in all, it depends on the individual and also the nature of the disease, but they should be obligated to inform their relatives if there are possibilities of curing or preventing it.",
  "123": "Genetic testing is a personal decision, with the knowledge that there is a possibility that one could be a carrier or not.",
  "124": "Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing, even if there is no risk at all.",
  "125": "Early pre-examination is healthy, as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological state of those who are affected.",
  "126": "For a genetic risk carrier, there should be a choice given with regard to informing his/her relatives.",
  "127": "There should not be a forceful or obligatory requirement for them to do so, as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier.",
  "128": "With regard to this choice, there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision-making.",
  "129": "If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child, then the decision of informing the relative should most likely be made with the consideration of the patient's parents or legal guardian.",
  "130": "Such patients are still emotionally volatile, or they may be unaware of the consequences of this genetic disorder due to their young age.",
  "131": "Furthermore, informing others without the consent of their parents or the patients themselves could harm the psychological state of the affected family.",
  "132": "Thus, much thought needs to be put into the immediate family because it could cause a stir of unwanted events from either the patient or the family members.",
  "133": "Some families may feel hurt, with regard to their family pride or reputation, on learning of such a genetic disorder running in their family.",
  "134": "However, there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives, since it is a genetic disorder.",
  "135": "There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and other families in the same family tree.",
  "136": "The importance of informing relatives of such a genetic disease is vital as it may help raise awareness and prevention of the genetic disorder.",
  "137": "Also, this known information will help their relatives make informed decisions and undergo genetic testing similarly to find out about the outcome.",
  "138": "Thus, having the knowledge that such a genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotional thoughts.",
  "139": "And if the results turn out to be otherwise, then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome and help them make upcoming decisions.",
  "140": "In addition, the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is made known to them.",
  "141": "Having support from relatives is vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness. It will certainly provide a morale boost, as the whole family will share a common sentiment toward the future prospect of the genetic disorder, which could be inherited by anyone in the family.",
  "142": "Therefore, the decision to inform relatives of such a genetic disorder will be dependent on the situation and background of the affected family, with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision to inform others.",
  "143": "A person with a disorder, regardless of whether mental or physical, is always easy for their families to be aware of. (Note: I assumed the intended meaning was for \"is always easy for their families to be aware of the person's disorder\", but if the intended meaning was something else, a different correction might be needed.)",
  "144": "When it comes to genetic issues, it's not that simple anymore.",
  "145": "Genetic disorder inheritance occurs from generation to generation, but not all offspring show the relevant symptoms.",
  "146": "Sometimes a family with a potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect potential harm in their bodies because no members reflect any observable disorder symptoms.",
  "147": "As a result, if one of the members happens to feel uncomfortable or unusual, he or she should be aware if the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not.",
  "148": "Afterward, the carrier will face a serious ethical issue: whether to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not.",
  "149": "If the disorder's symptoms reflect on a child, the parent will be informed by the medics for sure. Then, the whole family will stay alert to their body conditions.",
  "150": "On the contrary, if the carrier is an adult who has the choice to inform relatives about the risk, that is more complex.",
  "151": "One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself, there is no doubt he or she will tell his or her family about the issue.",
  "152": "That is true, and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family.",
  "153": "Think of it this way, if a child in the family knows he has the risk of becoming a genetic risk carrier and that risk might be passed down to his children in the future, his whole life will be full of dilemmas.",
  "154": "And of course, he or she will think of not having any children after getting married, and the same thought goes to cousins as well.",
  "155": "As a result, the family line stops at the moment the adult carrier announces his retirement.",
  "156": "In China, the older generation, with a traditional culture background, will always think of having more children and grandchildren to make the family livelier and stronger.",
  "157": "The reason is that, after World War II, the population of China decreased dramatically, and so the government encouraged people to have more children.",
  "158": "During that period, if one of the family members reflects genetic disorder symptoms, he will feel an ethical dilemma for sure.",
  "159": "The medical treatment technology at that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him.",
  "160": "He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperous with a potential generic risk.",
  "161": "And so, he would have chosen not to undergo genetic disorder testing and let the truth be hidden forever.",
  "162": "This kind of ethical issue can't be judged by others, because they will not understand the carrier's position and duty in the family.",
  "163": "In conclusion, people should think carefully about the consequences of revealing to relatives one's genetic disorder issue.",
  "164": "It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives, but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family.",
  "165": "Regardless of whether the disorder is rarely fatal or doesn't cause any inconvenience to the carrier, revealing the truth is always the right thing to do.",
  "166": "In my opinion, the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it.",
  "167": "One of the reasons is because, as a carrier, she or he needs mental support to get through this situation.",
  "168": "It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on its own. (No changes needed, the sentence is already grammatically correct.)",
  "169": "By telling his or her family (instead of \"to his or her family\"), other than being a support, they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem she is facing right now.",
  "170": "Other than that, I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support in our career.",
  "171": "Furthermore, as it is a genetic problem, it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family, as other family members might experience the same thing.",
  "172": "By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem, they could have a full check-up for themselves, and it would be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves.",
  "173": "I find that it is important to inform, especially if it is contagious, as the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to society.",
  "174": "For every action, there are always pros and cons.",
  "175": "I believe that some carriers will choose not to reveal their disease to family members, as they don't want to make them worry, feel uncomfortable, or even feel ostracized.",
  "176": "Furthermore, as it could incur significant spending for treatment, the carrier might not want to be a burden on her family.",
  "177": "I could understand the feelings of the carrier.",
  "178": "She or he doesn't want to be the source of unhappiness in the family.",
  "179": "However, we will never know whether these negative effects will happen when the carrier decides to tell his/her family about his/her condition.",
  "180": "In conclusion, personally I feel it is better for the carrier to inform his/her family members about the issue.",
  "181": "The carrier should be honest about his or her feelings, and I find that it is the right of family members to know what is going on in his or her life.",
  "182": "If anything wrong happens to the carrier's life without informing family members, it could cause huge regret in their lives if he/she leaves without them knowing about it. (Gender-neutral language and rectified grammatical errors)",
  "183": "On top of that, it's better to think about solutions for her problem with family members, as there are more heads to think about it, rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own.",
  "184": "In the end, I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help you to fight against the genetic disease. (changed carrier to you)",
  "185": "True enough, there are many cancer patients who have been given a second chance to live as normal persons, thanks to their strong mental support from their loved ones.",
  "186": "In my opinion, as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong, we can fight any disease that comes to us when we are fragile and weak.",
  "187": "As technology has been advancing, it has reached a stage where the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to its actual use.",
  "188": "Genetic testing has become possible, making it easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk.",
  "189": "If used for a good purpose, it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness. However, it could also make the situation worse by revealing who the carrier is, within the family.",
  "190": "The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I believe that he or she has the right not to know.",
  "191": "Firstly, genetic testing is not compulsory.",
  "192": "Of course, some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier. However, the carrier, before the testing, can choose not to go for the test and simply live with the unknowns and accept the facts.",
  "193": "If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and is willing to accept it, he could do that. And it has been something \"normal\" for everyone in the past, as genetic testing was not possible.",
  "194": "It could be better for him or her this way.",
  "195": "Some people might say that it is a form of preventing the birth of lives with disabilities and sparing them from suffering in real life.",
  "196": "I personally think this is the right purpose of going through genetic testing: so that a family who cannot afford to have a child with disabilities does not have to give birth to a child and make the entire family suffer.",
  "197": "However, I believe that the carrier has the right not to obligate anyone, but has the responsibility to take action to prevent any ethical dilemma.",
  "198": "If the result turned out to be something that the carrier cannot accept, then it would have been better not to know the truth.",
  "199": "I believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the true fact. OR I believe that even carriers have the right not to know the true facts.",
  "200": "After realizing he or she is the carrier, the emotional damage would be hard to bear.",
  "201": "It could possibly cause a problem in a family, due to the fact that it creates more unhappiness in the family.",
  "202": "Overall, I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face them with relatives, but he has no obligation to tell yet.",
  "203": "In fact, I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and take appropriate action based on the results.",
  "204": "The emotional depression that a carrier might experience, along with a sense of guilt, can be more than expected and could be a burden for the rest of one's life.",
  "205": "On the other hand, without knowing about any genetic disorder and accepting the fact, the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the disability.",
  "206": "I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is, without having emotional stress.",
  "207": "Debates have been around for years: should carriers of a known genetic risk be obligated to inform their relatives?",
  "208": "Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing, but whether the results should be informed to others, especially close family or relatives, is a topic worth discussing.",
  "209": "This is an issue that needs to be addressed, as it involves a family-related ethical dilemma.",
  "210": "In this essay, a few arguments will be pointed out in support of the view that any carrier of that known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives.",
  "211": "When we were born, we were surrounded by our family and relatives, who welcomed us to this new world.",
  "212": "We were crying hard, but we were not alone; it was our family and relatives who had raised us.",
  "213": "Hence, they should be the people we are grateful for and the people with whom we would like to share the joy.",
  "214": " However, in the case of any health issue, or to the extent of a serious disorder, it may seem there is no point in sharing, but this involves more than just the sharing of bad news.",
  "215": "One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone, but it's also one's responsibility to inform family and close relatives.",
  "216": "As the case of the health issue is related to genetic risk, with the keyword being \"genetic,\" it highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation.",
  "217": "Therefore, I would agree that it is obligated for a carrier of known genetic risk to inform their relatives, in order to avoid any family-related ethical dilemmas that could arise in the future.",
  "218": "Despite what one may argue, it's still up to the individual to disclose such a health issue or to bear it within themselves. However, it's certainly helpful to share with close relatives for a proper discussion of solutions.",
  "219": "By doing so, one will feel less stressed when facing the risk of disorder.",
  "220": "Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more caring toward a carrier of a known genetic risk.",
  "221": "By informing them, the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle against such disorder risk.",
  "222": "On top of that, because the genetic risk may be passed down to the next generation, it will involve more than just one family.",
  "223": "It is therefore that I would agree to the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth.",
  "224": "This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas.",
  "225": "There are more intangible advantages that could support the decision to inform relatives once the test results are known.",
  "226": "In conclusion, in order to avoid family-related ethical dilemmas, it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform their relatives.",
  "227": "The benefits of doing so are able to outweigh its disadvantage.",
  "228": "More support should be provided through different means to give better direction when one is at such a junction, about whether to inform relatives.",
  "229": "The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder.",
  "230": "This is common law in our society. OR This is a common law in society.",
  "231": "However, it leads to a new problem: \"Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives?\"",
  "232": "\"This issue has been discussed for a long time.\" (added missing closing quotation mark)",
  "233": "However, there is still a diversity of points of view among the people.",
  "234": "Therefore, we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue \"should we or should we not\" [",
  "235": "Firstly, I believe most of us will agree with the following sentence: \"I will be anxious about my family when he or she tells me that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk.\"",
  "236": "Frequently, the intention of the carriers is not to tell their families because they want to continue their own life without the anxiety of their families.",
  "237": "It is obvious that it will be better for one person to worry than for many.",
  "238": "However, many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges on their own.",
  "239": "With the family's support, there must be more energy to fight against the demon.",
  "240": "Demons are not easily defeated and they require much energy and psychological support. (I changed \"Demon\" to \"Demons\" because it is more idiomatic to use the plural form in this context.)",
  "241": "Families give you the courage and support that you cannot retrieve by yourself.",
  "242": "Those are the most essential elements for overcoming the challenges.",
  "243": "Besides that, the risk of known genetics is very serious and cannot be described.",
  "244": "The seriousness can be greater than we can imagine.",
  "245": "Lying on the bed for the rest of one's life, and even dying immediately, these are consequences that we cannot imagine.",
  "246": "Families are the dearest to us in our lives.",
  "247": "Without their concern and support, we would not have been able to make it until now.",
  "248": "They play an important role in our lives that cannot be substituted.",
  "249": "A known genetic risk can also critically affect our next generation.",
  "250": "Therefore, it is our responsibility to tell the relatives to prevent undesirable consequences.",
  "251": "Generally, the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier's families without the carrier's agreement.",
  "252": "It is the ethical duty of hospital staff to keep the secrets of any patients.",
  "253": "We cannot blame them for being liable to the undesired consequences.",
  "254": "However, a hospital can provide a counselor to advise the patient about the actions that can be taken. (I assumed you meant \"patient\" instead of \"carrier\".)",
  "255": "Therefore, this kind of circumstance will not happen again.",
  "256": "It is a method that benefits both parties, a win-win situation.",
  "257": "In conclusion, a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to inform his or her relatives about the known risk.",
  "258": "However, there may be some special cases that are hard to define.",
  "259": "Thus, advice from hospitals plays an important role in this.",
  "260": "The carrier is responsible for balancing his or her own interests and the benefits of family, and even society.",
  "261": "It is a hard decision to make, but with the most appropriate approach, it will create great circumstances for the career and families in the future.",
  "262": "With the risk of being genetically disordered, many individuals have decided to undergo genetic testing.",
  "263": "With the knowledge that the results will be known only once the tests are done, each individual who is diagnosed as a genetic risk carrier faces an ethical problem: They should warn their relatives about the risk of being the same genetic risk carrier.",
  "264": "Or they can choose to remain silent until the next carrier is diagnosed.",
  "265": "In my view, a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives, with the support of the following reasons.",
  "266": "First of all, from the point of view of human rights, a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others.",
  "267": "This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy for carriers.",
  "268": "They may not want this truth to influence their lives or want to keep it a secret and not let others know about it.",
  "269": "This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated against or pitied by others, which are not positive factors brought to their lives.",
  "270": "Secondly, the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing, regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier.",
  "271": "When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers, they can go and consult a doctor.",
  "272": "If they don't want to think too much about it and view it as a trouble, they may just ignore the possibility.",
  "273": "However, if a diagnosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives, the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers.",
  "274": "This obeys their own willingness, as in they have to accept the truth, which may make their following life miserable.",
  "275": "Many people argue that setting obligations may help more people, who are the relatives of carriers, save their lives with a larger opportunity due to early diagnosis.",
  "276": "However, this is not exactly true when other factors, including psychological influences and social influences, are taken into consideration. (Added the word \"influences\" to make the sentence grammatically correct)",
  "277": "If a relative is told that they may have a higher risk of getting sick, they may be scared about the unknown, partners, spouse, and colleagues may choose to leave, and many other situations may happen, which means their life may be ruined.",
  "278": "On the other hand, as stated above, a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the results can choose to do the genetic testing individually.",
  "279": "In a nutshell, a carrier of a known genetic risk should have the right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not.",
  "280": "This should be accepted from the standpoint of human rights: freedom of acceptance of relatives as well as many other social reasons.",
  "281": "Otherwise, making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives.",
  "282": "For a carrier of a genetic disorder to know the fact that he or she is a carrier, it causes more dilemma than it would to have the disorder.",
  "283": "I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his/her relatives.",
  "284": " There are four reasons why people don't have to be shy about sharing their problems regarding genetic disorders.",
  "285": "Firstly, the carrier and his/her family can take precautions by taking physical actions to reduce the chance of it being inherited by offspring and, mentally, if the actions fail to prevent its inheritance.",
  "286": "Many syndromes, such as Down Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome, can be prevented if the mother undergoes proper medication and avoids consuming harmful goods during the pregnancy period.",
  "287": "This information may not be known by the mother if she doesn't tell her relatives about her condition.",
  "288": "The more people (relatives) know her problem, the more information channels are provided.",
  "289": "If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome, then the family has to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring about a good environment for their children's growth.",
  "290": "This is not the parents' fault because there is still a chance of the gene being inherited.",
  "291": "So they have to prepare mentally as well.",
  "292": "Secondly, genetic diseases cost highly for treatment and medication.",
  "293": "Albinism is one example.",
  "294": "People with albinism have sensitive skin and it requires regular treatment.",
  "295": "Unlike people with a high proportion of skin pigment, people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases.",
  "296": "If they don't treat their bodies well, such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen outdoors, the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer.",
  "297": "Once you suffer from cancer, the cost of medication is very expensive.",
  "298": "To prevent a bigger problem from happening, it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body.",
  "299": "If the carrier does not tell his or her relatives, it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially.",
  "300": "Thirdly, some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems. (No change needed, the sentence is grammatically correct.)",
  "301": "One of the diseases is sickle cell disease.",
  "302": "Usually, people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene, and this may lead to circulatory problems such as blood clotting.",
  "303": "If parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives, they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and should not be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children's health.",
  "304": "Fourthly, it is important for parents to give mental support to their children with genetic disorders.",
  "305": "When their children become teenagers, a lot of social problems may arise.",
  "306": "People and friends often mock your conditions.",
  "307": "A strong mental condition and conviction must be built from within and by the people who are closest to you.",
  "308": "If not their family, then who else is willing to do that?",
  "309": "It is not a heavy burden for the family if they have prepared themselves mentally by disclosing the information about the probability that their children may suffer from a genetic disorder.",
  "310": "In this modern world, technologies have improved a lot compared to those of the last century.",
  "311": "Particularly in the medical field, there has been a great improvement in many treatments for many formerly incurable diseases, and genetic testing is one of the methods used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder.",
  "312": "The medical authorities claimed that only the individual at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing.",
  "313": "However, once a test has been conducted and the results are known, a family-related ethical dilemma is born.",
  "314": "The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his/her relatives.",
  "315": "In my opinion, the carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives about this.",
  "316": "This is because their relatives have the right to know about this.",
  "317": "As many people realize, a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier's relatives. That is, if one family member is at risk for a genetic disorder, other family members also have almost an equally high risk of having it. Therefore, this problem should be treated seriously by the family.",
  "318": "Every family member has their human right to know what is going on with them. (The possessive form \"their\" is used correctly in this sentence.)",
  "319": "If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder, how can this explain their rights?",
  "320": "For instance, John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder, but he does not tell his sibling, James about this.",
  "321": "Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent, he should know what is likely to be going on for him.",
  "322": "This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder.",
  "323": "The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the same genetic disorder, thereby preventing certain genetic disorders from affecting them.",
  "324": "Genetic disorders are innate, but the great improvement in medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves.",
  "325": "In addition, doctors usually quote the statement, \"Prevention is better than cure,\" which gives us an idea that preventing a disorder from happening has far more advantages than curing it.",
  "326": "Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person, and therefore, this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible.",
  "327": "For example, hypertension is partially due to genetic factors, but environmental factors also play an important role.",
  "328": "People who are aware of having such a disorder can prevent its occurrence by adapting a healthy lifestyle, including having a balanced diet and exercising for at least 30 minutes every day.",
  "329": "To summarize, a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives.",
  "330": "This is their human right to know about it, and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder's occurrence.",
  "331": " Along with the advancement of technology over the past decades, medical advancement has increased exponentially and is still undergoing constant enhancements. This empowers doctors with advanced medical knowledge, allowing them to diagnose and conduct genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their life. However, once a test has been conducted and the results are known, the question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives becomes a challenging issue for both patient and doctor. In my opinion, I strongly urge support for the obligation to inform a patient's relatives.",
  "332": " \"As it is a genetic risk, the patient's next-of-kin might have a high chance of carrying the risk, hence the need to inform their relatives is important, so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances occur. For example, if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately, you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child, hence by letting your family members aware of the situation, it would lessen family stresses and suffering, and may prevent forcing you to settle down and have children. However, social ethical issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforcing patients or doctors to disclose information to patients' relatives, which challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles. Currently, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in the United States, there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives; it is up to the patient's wish to disclose to their family members. Early disclosure to family members brings positive reactions and prevention, as in the case of Angelina Jolie, who chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent. I still recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she did not want to live under the shadow of cancer.\"",
  "333": "However, there are still people against the decision to reveal private information. As in the case of Alzheimer's patients, it is up to the patient's own choice to disclose information. However, research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who, how, and to whom Alzheimer's disease should be disclosed to minimize potential negative impacts on family members (Dementia Today, 2012). There are associations that provide help to Alzheimer's patients, such as the Alzheimer's Association (Alzheimer's Association, 1980). Although there are still thousands of genetic risk diseases out there that may not be receiving all helps and support from everyone, the need for immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need during their difficult times.",
  "334": " In conclusion, the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors about the extent to which a doctor should opt to reveal to relatives about the genetic disease, and in which situations it is open to the patient's decision. In addition, the state could also encourage the creation of assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients, to encourage them to open up for the benefit of themselves and their family members. Although it may face challenges from social ethics issues, in the long term, with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government, more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones.",
  "335": "Nowadays, the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancements.",
  "336": "Not long ago, the human genome project sponsored by several large multinational corporations (MNCs) started.",
  "337": "In comparison, in the field of genetic testing, which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder (as the technology is already quite mature), an even more popular topic arises.",
  "338": "While most people agree that each individual has the right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not, they have different stands on whether it is the patient's responsibility or the patient's freedom to share the results with his or her relatives.",
  "339": "In my opinion, patients who are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members.",
  "340": "Admittedly, it is a social obligation to be responsible for the lives of other people.",
  "341": "To the whole society, it is a duty. (No changes needed)",
  "342": "Take H1N1 as an example; all people in Singapore, including students at school, travelers at Changi Airport, workers in offices, and passengers on the street, are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge.",
  "343": "To those family members who care about them, it is also a moral obligation. (No changes needed, no grammatical or spelling errors found.)",
  "344": "How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger?",
  "345": "The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other without doubts.",
  "346": "Without trust and love, there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together.",
  "347": "Hence, it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder, both as a social responsibility and as a favor to preserve the family base.",
  "348": "Moreover, telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support.",
  "349": "Without the support of loved ones, a patient's life is no better than death.",
  "350": "Family members, being one of the closest groups of people from whom they can get comfort, are a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of a genetic disorder.",
  "351": "A study by New York University in 2010 showed that patients with family members around generally recover 2-4 days faster than those cared for by professional nurses.",
  "352": "Even for patients with terminal diseases, the duration of their survival is 30% longer due to family support.",
  "353": "Some people may say that telling the truth may give rise to unnecessary doubts and panics, which could endanger family harmony.",
  "354": "While every family needs to go through difficult situations sometimes, the more troubles a family has gone through together, the greater the bond established between family members, as well as the greater the amount of trust, love, and understanding.",
  "355": " Hence, for a family in which every member truly believes in and loves each other, all these troubles are just testimonies that will make them stronger. (Note: I changed \"is\" to \"are\" to agree with \"troubles\" and \"testaments\" to \"testimonies\" as a more common term for that metaphorical usage. When it comes to language, sometimes there's no \"smallest change\" that can preserve the original meaning and still be perfectly natural-sounding.)",
  "356": "Just as Kelly Clarkson's lyrics say, \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\"",
  "357": "Being in an Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice, I do think that it is the patient's choice whether to tell relatives about his or her disease.",
  "358": "The courage to take the genetic testing and inform their relatives about the risk they may have can result in people being judgmental, while it is actually just a risk, not a confirmed case.",
  "359": "Furthermore, since it is the person's gene that is affected, he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information.",
  "360": " Nevertheless, while I feel that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk, I would like to suggest that the person at least share the information with their potential partner (husband or wife), since the individual's genetic risk may affect their future children.",
  "361": "Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases, and many of them will likely judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases because they feel that the patients are abnormal or weird.",
  "362": "This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as bubble-boy disease, autism, or Down syndrome.",
  "363": "In those diseases, many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the diseases.",
  "364": "While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations, many people still do it, with or without realizing it.",
  "365": "In this particular case, we are discussing whether a person should tell his relatives about his having a risk of a particular genetic disease.",
  "366": "It is normal for people to demand fair and similar treatment as that received by others, and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case they are judged or treated differently. Also, many people really love to hear what they want to hear, and therefore they may just ignore the word \"risk\" and assume that the person has the disease.",
  "367": "To prevent that from happening, I do feel that it's up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family, since his family may either be paranoid, judge him, and act differently.",
  "368": "Especially when it's just a risk, the option is really his, since he is not an actual sufferer.",
  "369": "There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell family members about the risk, since some of them may be affected. While I do think this view has a point, the level of trust one has in their family regarding this issue may also be a factor.",
  "370": "Maybe we can trust our immediate family members, but can we really trust all the other relatives?",
  "371": "Furthermore, since genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case, it is up to the person to decide whether to tell relatives about it.",
  "372": "However, as I said earlier, it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since his or her genetic risk may affect his or her children later. (I added \"or her\" after \"his\" to make it grammatically correct. It made no big change but I hope my change is what you want.)",
  "373": "This information needs to be acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children.",
  "374": " There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers, and therefore, they should consider not having children, since their child may not be able to survive even after being born. (I added \"consider\" to make it sound better and added \"being\" after \"even after\" for clarity)",
  "375": "Or, in a less extreme case, the child may be disabled.",
  "376": "This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters, therefore, although no one is obliged to tell anyone about their genetic risk, it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner.",
  "377": "In conclusion, whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives about his genetic risk, the choice is his, because it is his gene and he has the full right to it.",
  "378": "He may have different considerations, other than judging people or making his family worry unnecessarily, when thinking about whether to tell his relatives. No matter what choice he makes, we need to respect it and have no right to say that he must tell his relatives about it.",
  "379": "We all know that life is priceless, and we have no right to judge a person's death. (Corrected: added a apostrophe in \"person's\")",
  "380": "With the improvements in technology, a new life with genetic risks can be detected.",
  "381": "Genetic refers to the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease.",
  "382": "Therefore, an entirely new dilemma is born: should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives?",
  "383": "This essay will discuss the reasons why relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have a genetic risk.",
  "384": "One of the reasons that parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable of raising a child with genetic risk.",
  "385": "A child with a genetic risk may not have the ability to work, build a family with others, and is often not accepted by the majority.",
  "386": "They may not be able to enjoy what normal people can.",
  "387": "This competitive world is cruel to those who are not able to survive.",
  "388": "Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to foster their child if he/she is not able to be self-sufficient.",
  "389": "The situation may become worse if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease, which means that parents have another heavy burden: medication fees.",
  "390": "Not only the child but also the entire family will suffer.",
  "391": "It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that cannot work and may suffer pain for the entire life.",
  "392": "The other reason that parents should know if their baby is a carrier of genetic risk is for the good of the nation.",
  "393": "There are always newspaper reports that a newborn baby has been abandoned at a hospital after the parents realized that the baby has diseases that require a huge amount of money to secure.",
  "394": "For countries like Singapore, they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation.",
  "395": "However, every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disabled, such as providing medical subsidies and building special schools to educate them.",
  "396": "Without increasing the number of the disabled in a nation, the government is able to concentrate on developing other areas, such as the military and education.",
  "397": "As citizens of a nation, they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways.",
  "398": "Moreover, in the world we are living in today, many miscarriages are conducted in hospitals every day.",
  "399": "It is easier for people to accept it morally.",
  "400": "Therefore, I believe that parents have a right to know the healthiness of their child.",
  "401": "Many people may support the theory that everyone has the right to enjoy the world, especially people with religious beliefs.",
  "402": "However, the problem is, will people really enjoy their lives if they have to stay in the hospital every day and deal with all the needles and endless pain?",
  "403": "Parents know what is best for their children, thus they will make the right decision after being informed.",
  "404": "Also, human beings should improve the medical field in order to prevent tragedies from happening.",
  "405": "I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his/her relatives.",
  "406": "Genetic testing is a personal choice.",
  "407": "One should have full control of their information and it is their right to decide whether or not to disclose it to someone else.",
  "408": "As far as I am concerned, when a couple is going to have a baby, they should run a few tests to see if they could have any genetic diseases.",
  "409": "The results are disclosed to husbands and wives.",
  "410": "This is not the case I'm talking about here.",
  "411": "The most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases.",
  "412": "They have the right to know whether they are at risk.",
  "413": "Also, telling them the results can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing.",
  "414": "They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of their having this disease.",
  "415": "If a person has disease C, it might be a result of gene A.",
  "416": "He runs a test and knows that he has the AA gene.",
  "417": "This means that both of his parents have gene A and are both at high risk for disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see if they are at high risk for disease C. If he runs a test and finds out that he has the gene Aa.",
  "418": "This means one of his parents has gene A, and one cost of testing could be saved.",
  "419": "His relatives can then take measures, if this disease can somehow be prevented, to stop it from taking their lives.",
  "420": "However, this can also be achieved through personal choice.",
  "421": "One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk.",
  "422": "Most people care about their relatives. If there is no serious consequence of telling them so, I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful.",
  "423": "One might also choose to hint or encourage certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that come with disclosing their genetic results.",
  "424": "There are possible negative consequences that they might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relatives.",
  "425": "If a person is obliged to tell his/her relatives, he/she might be discriminated against by those who do not carry this gene.",
  "426": "He or she might even be advised not to get married or to have children.",
  "427": "For example, if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very serious disease.",
  "428": "After he takes the test and is obligated to tell his relatives, everyone knows that he is a carrier.",
  "429": "So all married couples go run a test and find out they are not carriers. They might subconsciously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well.",
  "430": "Third, it is hard to define \"relatives.\" or Third, it is hard to define what constitutes a \"relative.\"",
  "431": "If a gene runs in the family, and one family member tests positive, whom do they need to tell?",
  "432": "If that is a big family, is he obligated to tell everyone?",
  "433": "Spouses usually have very close relationships. If person A tells his family that he has this gene, his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that she needs to run a test because her cousin has this disease.",
  "434": "However, wife D is not at risk of having this disease.",
  "435": "Then Wife D might tell her mother, who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre. (Assuming \"Wife D\" is a proper name, added a comma after the dialogue tag, following the standard punctuation.)",
  "436": "In less than a week, half of the town knows that person A has a high-risk gene, and his family might be a genetically high-risk one.",
  "437": "Then, no one wants to marry A, or his relatives.",
  "438": "This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control over their information, especially when the party they are obliged to disclose their information to is a potentially large group (relatives).",
  "439": "In conclusion, a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives.",
  "440": "Carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform their relatives.",
  "441": "Nowadays, people not only pursue the comfort of their own lives but also the better development of future generations.",
  "442": "Since the technology of modern society has advanced so much, it has become possible for people to make the decision to take a genetic test and find out if they carry a genetic risk that could affect their next generation.",

  "767": "Not only did the phone do the jobs for them, but also devices like personal computers, laptops, tablets, and many other devices that are able to connect to the internet.",
  "768": "It is obvious to see that the internet saves people's time and also connects people globally.",
  "769": "Several arguments have been made regarding the fact that social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages for people.",
  "770": "People can only use electrical devices to access the internet.",
  "771": "Whenever they need to use social media, they have to use a phone or access the internet.",
  "772": "Generally, people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and their fingers to manipulate the corresponding device.",
  "773": "As a result, they will lose eyes for contact and hands to express their feelings to people nearby, which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face communication.",
  "774": "This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays.",
  "775": "A family of four is having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting because each member is holding and looking at their display screen with one hand while the other is holding a fork.",
  "776": "A group of friends having high tea in a caf\u00e9 without chatting, as they don't know what to talk about and are just pressing on their display screens.",
  "777": "The children nowadays don't know what neighborhood games are, and they don't know who is staying beside them; all they know is pressing icons on screens.",
  "778": "These are some concrete examples of how social media reduce face-to-face human contact.",
  "779": "When people get used to using social media to contact others, their interpersonal communication skills will degrade and be lost eventually.",
  "780": "Firstly, they have lost the courage to meet strangers, let alone talk.",
  "781": "Also, they will not have enough experience to communicate with people face-to-face and will not be trained in their conversation skills.",
  "782": "As a result, social media helps them do their jobs but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills.",
  "783": "Social media does have some other advantages besides their general benefits to human beings.",
  "784": "First of all, people save money by using the internet to contact others and read news.",
  "785": "A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in another country via social media software instead of making an international call, which is expensive for a normal salary family.",
  "786": "He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face via video call over the internet.",
  "787": "Secondly, people make friends all over the world and are able to update their friends on their recent activities easily.",
  "788": "A guy who is going to travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activities.",
  "789": "When one of his friends, who is not aware of this, has failed to contact him via telephone calls, he might be able to get his whereabouts using social media.",
  "790": "These are the advantages that save us work most of the time.",
  "791": "In conclusion, social media benefits people in several ways but also harms people.",
  "792": "People should avoid the misuse of social media and use it in the proper way.",
  "793": "With the aid of social media, people bond globally, information flows rapidly, and human lives are made happier.",
  "794": "All of us are living in a technology-realm society.",
  "795": "Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with others?",
  "796": "It started with the invention of technology, which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades.",
  "797": "In the past, we traveled by ship, and now we can use airplanes to do so.",
  "798": "In the past, it took a few days to receive a message, as we needed to post our letters. Now, we can use email, which stands for electronic mail, to send messages to our friends, or even use our handphones to send messages.",
  "799": "From the example that I mentioned earlier, we can see that the distance between us and our loved ones is getting greater.",
  "800": "This is because, with the ease of technology such as airplanes, some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even moving away from their families to pursue studies or careers in life.",
  "801": "Thus, this makes Twitter and Facebook one of the media that we need.",
  "802": "Nevertheless, everything in life has positive and negative effects.",
  "803": "This is applicable to these social media sites.",
  "804": "The next two paragraphs will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society.",
  "805": "With the help of social media tools, we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up-to-date with our family and friends even when we are away from them.",
  "806": "Social media sites such as Facebook have allowed us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas.",
  "807": "These approaches help parents communicate with their children and know what kind of activities their children have when they are overseas.",
  "808": "The social media is beneficial as it connects you and your loved ones, even when you are separated by distance.",
  "809": "It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family, but it could help reduce the sadness of being away from your family.",
  "810": "As I mentioned at the beginning, there are also disadvantages to social media tools.",
  "811": "One of them is that it reduces the level of concentration, especially among youngsters.",
  "812": "This is because it is part of everyone's habit to check their Facebook page, as their friends will post something new every second.",
  "813": "Thus, you can see that some students will browse Facebook while attending lectures.",
  "814": "This means that the students are not concentrating when they are supposed to be doing so.",
  "815": "As a result, it could affect their lives and their studies.",
  "816": "This will then could lead to stress because these students are not able to cope with their studies, as they were distracted.",
  "817": "In my opinion, every individual has to take responsibility for their own lives by making the right decisions.",
  "818": "There are advantages and disadvantages to using social media sites, but in this case striking a balance between social media and real life is the most important thing to do.",
  "819": "Nowadays, the use of social media platforms is commonplace in our lives.",
  "820": "In an increasingly globalized world, such platforms enhance and complicate the links between individuals in the world.",
  "821": "Thanks to them, people can get to know one another online without having to travel to meet up for business purposes or for personal reasons.",
  "822": "However, it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real world, resulting in negative impacts on individuals' daily lives and, therefore, becoming a large problem in societies as a whole.",
  "823": "As people spend more and more time on such social media sites, the importance of face-to-face human contacts has decreased.",
  "824": "As people feel more confident online, where they don't have to face others in real life on the spot, they feel more comfortable and thus prefer to communicate online.",
  "825": "This results in a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals, especially young students, as they always have the option to turn their backs on real-life and go online.",
  "826": "This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but to face things in real life.",
  "827": "As they are so used to having an online avatar, they may lose their sense of self-identity in real life and may not know how to interact with people in real life.",
  "828": "Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy are not reflected as something positive to the users.",
  "829": "The reason why it is so addictive is that the more people get into social media, the more they seek attention from their friends.",
  "830": "However, such sparks of sudden attention are extremely short-term and fade easily, thus adding no value or meaning to the user's life.",
  "831": "Also, according to a research, it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook, and this is because users unconsciously compare their lives with others' lives.",
  "832": "But seriously, most people only post the happiest moments in their lives.",
  "833": "Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make users stay; it's the links among the people.",
  "834": "Indeed, I myself use Facebook just for the friends' contacts that I want to keep.",
  "835": "However, the friendship in such a virtual world is so superficial, which is not very relevant to the real world.",
  "836": "Also, as numerous profit-driven companies realize the huge human traffic on such social media sites, they make it a pond to fish for customers by uploading many advertisements.",
  "837": "Furthermore, this also possibly triggers privacy issues as Facebook allows some profit-driven companies to have access to users' information.",
  "838": "As this happens, users are more and more prone to any possible frauds.",
  "839": " Social media sites are at their peaks at the moment. However, I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better people in real life, they will not be drawn to them as much as they are now.",
  "840": "The users will soon realize that they don't need such social media sites to keep in contact with their friends because, if they really need someone, they will reach out to them no matter what.",
  "841": "We think we are all connected through various social media, but are we really getting connected, or are we falling apart?",
  "842": "Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people from around the world.",
  "843": "The idea seems great, and nowadays most people, even the older generation, will have at least one social media platform like Facebook.",
  "844": "The parents are now the \"friends\" of their kids, and they can now \"follow\" their kids more closely and in real time.",
  "845": "People post about their random thoughts and daily activities on Twitter and frequently post different kinds of photos on Facebook to stay connected with their so-called friends.",
  "846": "However, as we tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced face-to-face human contact, that eventually affects our interpersonal skills.",
  "847": "First and foremost, I would like to share the advantages of using such social media in my daily life.",
  "848": "As a student, I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and at different settings.",
  "849": "We may meet only once, but we exchange our contact numbers as well as Facebook accounts in order to keep in touch.",
  "850": "Unlike merely keeping contact numbers that we may not even call, social media like Facebook is a great way for friends from different fields or even from different parts of the world to stay connected.",
  "851": "Within clicks, we could check a friend's profile and read their updates.",
  "852": "On the other hand, we could update our profile by posting on the wall, and our friends could read up on the newsfeed.",
  "853": "This allows friends who may not have time to meet up to still stay connected in a way.",
  "854": "Not only that, but new friends can be easily met through such online platforms.",
  "855": "Hence, our social circle is indeed expanding.",
  "856": "Nonetheless, what seems to connect us can also be the cause of our downfall.",
  "857": "The obvious disadvantage of using social media is the reduction of face-to-face contact.",
  "858": "This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circles.",
  "859": "For example, we tend to send a birthday wish when Facebook prompts us \"Today is someone's birthday.\"",
  "860": "In fact, we may have just forgotten our friend's birthday.",
  "861": "We used to send wishes cards during festive seasons like Chinese New Year, and we feel so good to write one, and of course, to receive one with stamps on it.",
  "862": "Gone were the times, and now we do mass sendings, and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes.",
  "863": "As time passes, we may have more \"friends\" on the list, but the meaning of friendship needs to be redefined.",
  "864": "In a nutshell, every sword has two edges.",
  "865": "The users of every social media site need to strike a balance between the real world and the virtual one.",
  "866": "We should maximize the benefits of such platforms, but be careful of their impacts on the actual lives that we have.",
  "867": "Ultimately, the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings, but social media sites are only tools to enhance it.",
  "868": "Nowadays, social media sites are commonly used in society.",
  "869": "I believe that 80% of people play social media sites.",
  "870": "These sites play the role of connecting people around the world.",
  "871": "It consists of the functions of connecting, sharing, interacting, and advertising.",
  "872": "However, there are also some disadvantages that occur due to social media that are a concern in society.",
  "873": "Therefore, this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily lives.",
  "874": "First, with the function of social media sites that connect people, everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families, or even strangers without any time or place constraints.",
  "875": "Through social media sites, we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand.",
  "876": "There are over a thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries.",
  "877": "However, we are able to chat with our friends without traveling to other countries.",
  "878": "It saves a lot of money and time, as well as strengthening our relationship, even though we stay at different places around the world.",
  "879": "Besides that, a company can also use the convenience of social media sites, such as Facebook chat or Skype, to facilitate meetings with parties of a project from around the world.",
  "880": "Substantial cost is saved without the tiring travel from one place to another.",
  "881": "With the huge amount of cost savings, this capital can be utilized in other sectors, which will benefit the company more and boost up its profit.",
  "882": "However, there are always two sides to a story.",
  "883": "Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces face-to-face connections between humans.",
  "884": "Since ancient times, humans have interacted with each other face to face.",
  "885": "Without facial expressions, it is easier to misunderstand the intentions of speakers.",
  "886": "That is why facial expressions are one of the most important elements in social learning.",
  "887": "In addition, \"social media sites will affect writing skills\" is a point of view in society.",
  "888": "Based on the statistical report, the more time spent on social media sites, the more writing skills will be reduced.",
  "889": "I believe most of us have experienced suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know.",
  "890": "The auto-correction software is so effective when using electronic devices that we sometimes don't realize the importance of writing.",
  "891": "Writing is an essential skill for a person who wants to express their own feelings and opinions.",
  "892": "\"Privacy,\" this is the word that has been popular in the past few decades.",
  "893": "Humans have their own rights and privacy.",
  "894": "I believe that most of us agree to these terms.",
  "895": "However, there is news about social media sites leaking users' information to companies for cash reimbursement.",
  "896": "Everything we type in social media sites is recorded on servers and then transferred to companies for spying and advertising.",
  "897": "Although it may appear that there are no laws, and it seems like your own space where you can speak and do anything you want, you are actually wrong.",
  "898": "You are not only controlled by government laws but also spied on by the government.",
  "899": "In conclusion, everything has two sides.",
  "900": "It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites.",
  "901": "To utilize the technology well, we should do our best to not only balance the pros and cons but also to lengthen the pros and shorten the cons.",
  "902": "Thus, the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our generation and the next.",
  "903": "With the widespread use of advanced technology, social media sites are becoming more and more popular.",
  "904": "Getting connected on social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, has become a main trend as well as daily work nowadays.",
  "905": "With this situation, both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily life.",
  "906": "On one side, it is obviously that many advantages have been brought to our lives.",
  "907": "Social media provides people with the opportunity to get in contact with each other anytime and anywhere.",
  "908": "Whether we are at home, at school, at work, or on holiday, we are able to communicate and interact with our friends.",
  "909": "Even when people are thousands of miles apart, social media makes it possible to have interaction by allowing us to keep writing comments.",
  "910": "When our phones are accidentally damaged, we can also use social media to get in contact with our friends.",
  "911": "Some people who try to talk in public can also actively take part in group chats via social media.",
  "912": "Besides, we can make more friends by such interactions when our friends also bring their friends in.",
  "913": "Therefore, the popularity of social media sites has made it more convenient for people to update their friends' statuses and contact friends more frequently.",
  "914": "On the other hand, we need to rethink the influences brought by social media.",
  "915": "There are still many disadvantages of using social media.",
  "916": "Firstly, interpersonal skills may be affected by the reduction in face-to-face human contact. (Note: I corrected \"affacted\" to \"affected\".)",
  "917": "While social media brings convenience to people's lives, people are more and more willing to use it for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting, which has time and place requirements.",
  "918": "People who are not good at public speaking may be more reluctant to talk to people, and their interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation.",
  "919": "Secondly, people's over-addiction may avoidably, to some degree, exacerbate social alienation. This alienation causes some social media users to suffer from over-dependence on virtual social networking.",
  "920": "More and more networking has been transferred from real life to the internet.",
  "921": "This is a potential danger for teenagers growing up with social changes, and they may get hurt.",
  "922": "Thirdly, a lot of updating of luxury living standards, as well as other show-off situations, may make people's daily life more and more grandiloquent, which is not an accurate social trend.",
  "923": "Lastly, it is easy for people to waste a lot of time on social media.",
  "924": "Again, there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addiction, and their studies and work may be greatly influenced.",
  "925": "Since we can see both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media, and we can't deny the huge benefits it has brought to us, this main trend of using social media may be lasting for a long time.",
  "926": "Therefore, every time we use social media, we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages.",
  "927": "Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of social media.",
  "928": "In an era as sophisticated as this one, experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier.",
  "929": "Geographical and transportation borders are no longer a problem, because communication and information technologies have been enhanced continuously.",
  "930": "The telephone may have been perceived as the biggest innovation ever created when it was first introduced by Graham Bell.",
  "931": "However, since the internet became known, the telephone began to give way to social media sites.",
  "932": "Many advantages are given to users.",
  "933": "Let's take examples from Facebook and Twitter, two of the most famous social media sites.",
  "934": "Through Facebook, people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances.",
  "935": "This benefit can't be obtained through telephone or mail because people's particulars and addresses may change from time to time. On Facebook, people can keep in contact with old friends using only their names and photos as identifiers.",
  "936": "Facebook is like a combination of messaging and chat services, a personal profile, a media sharing platform, and other entertainment add-ons (e.g.,).",
  "937": "Social games, which allow users to communicate with remote people and also to update and express themselves at the same time.",
  "938": "Twitter, which has more simplified functions compared to Facebook, gives more benefits if used as an information-sharing medium.",
  "939": "Twitter allows users to give updates that are limited to short sentences in order to spread words quickly; this highlights only the most important messages.",
  "940": "For Facebook, a comprehensive way of sharing is offered, since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded, long notes can be published, and even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays.",
  "941": "These advantages also come in handy because most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones.",
  "942": "Despite the luxury that social media offers, there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize until later.",
  "943": "Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people addicted to social media sites has been decreasing.",
  "944": "As a consequence, it affects their interpersonal skills.",
  "945": "People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say, but in face-to-face communication, every word that comes out of your mouth, if not well-arranged, is a picture of your personality.",
  "946": "This skill requires practice and cannot be done completely through social media.",
  "947": "There is a situation where a family is having dinner together in a restaurant, but everyone is busy with their own gadgets, posting pictures on Facebook, updating their status on Twitter, or even chatting with friends.",
  "948": "These social media serve a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries, but it does not mean that surrounding people are neglected as a payoff.",
  "949": "This is related to the interpersonal skill that was mentioned before and can decrease qualitatively if we are used to facing gadgets instead of human beings.",
  "950": "Another disadvantage that affects others is that by only showing selected parts of our lives, we build \"false images\" in public.",
  "951": "We tend to only share our happy moments on media.",
  "952": "Because of this, other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problems at all.",
  "953": "Other people, then, are influenced by us and tend to do the same.",
  "954": "As a result, people think of themselves lowedly and this may lead to depression and mental disorders.",
  "955": "It also reduces our empathy.",
  "956": "This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people.",
  "957": "As explained above, modern and sophisticated technology does not always give advantages.",
  "958": "There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize.",
  "959": "It is up to people's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take.",
  "960": "So, we should never forget to think of and calculate the benefits and losses of every decision we make.",
  "961": "Nowadays, the advancement of technologies improves the lives of many people a lot.",
  "962": "In most countries, there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.",
  "963": "Many people think that social media sites have benefits for communication between people, while some others argue that there are several negative impacts on society.",
  "964": "One of the advantages that social media sites carry is that they can connect us more closely than before.",
  "965": "In the past decades, when social media sites were not yet fully developed, people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone or even a letter.",
  "966": "However, calling a person using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost, and sending a letter to a person who lives far away, especially in villages, takes much time. (Added \"using\" to make the sentence grammatically correct)",
  "967": "The appearance of these social media sites causes those problems to be solved.",
  "968": "People connecting through social media sites can spend no money on communication, and it takes only one or a few seconds for the message to reach.",
  "969": "Therefore, this advantage of social media sites saves money and time, and also provides convenience for many people.",
  "970": "Moreover, this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person they haven't seen for a very long time, such as primary and secondary school friends.",
  "971": "As we graduate from school, we will probably lose contact with some of our friends.",
  "972": "Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses, and we are not able to find them through phone calls or letters.",
  "973": "If a phone and a letter are the only ways to contact them, we would probably not be able to find them.",
  "974": "Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative way to make connections between us and our old friends.",
  "975": "Hence, social media sites serve as a platform for connection.",
  "976": "Everything that comes with benefits will also have its disadvantages.",
  "977": "On the other hand, social media sites also bring some negative impacts for people and society.",
  "978": "The advancement of those social media sites makes people so reliant on them that some prefer using those sites to contact each other instead of talking to each other face to face.",
  "979": "Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought about by social media sites.",
  "980": "The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life, which will in turn cause a loss of interpersonal skills for many people.",
  "981": "As we all know, interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and present our views and ideas.",
  "982": "The loss of interpersonal skills results in the inability of people to express their ideas well.",
  "983": "As a result, they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in society.",
  "984": "In conclusion, social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society.",
  "985": " As part of this modern society, we should learn to distinguish between the good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies, and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those sites.",
  "986": "With the advancement of technology in recent years, the need to stay in-touch with people and keep up with the latest news has become tremendous.",
  "987": "Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook.",
  "988": "With over a billion users, an increasing number from all over the world, social media sites have clearly demonstrated their success in playing an important part of our lives.",
  "989": "However, there are arguments that social media life brings about a reduction in face-to-face human contact, which in turn affects interpersonal skills. (Corrected: brought about -> brings about, had brought -> brings about)",
  "990": "Let's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives and in society.",
  "991": "First and foremost, all social media sites are free.",
  "992": "All users' needs are an internet connection and an email account, so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID and start their journey in social media life.",
  "993": "Secondly, it helps people stay in touch with one another.",
  "994": "Finding old friends through Facebook, for example, is easier than asking people around in real life.",
  "995": "Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer together.",
  "996": "Thirdly, social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world, all with just a click away on the refresh button.",
  "997": "Last but not least, social media sites also link people together by allowing us to create our own groups, pages, or sites to share our hobbies, interests, and studies in particular subjects.",
  "998": "Hence, it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our globally interconnected world.",
  "999": "However, social media sites also have their second side of negative impacts on humans.",
  "1000": "Undeniably, it becomes more addicting when we spend more time, busy socializing and interacting virtually.",
  "1001": "We spend the majority of our time on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and it affects our daily work productivity and performance.",
  "1002": "In the corporate world, employers often block social media networks to prevent employees from spending their office time on personal leisure rather than concentrating on their work.",
  "1003": "Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also brings a bad impact for us in the long term.",
  "1004": "The more time we spend on these sites, the less time we spend on face-to-face interactions with one another.",
  "1005": "Hence, it lessens valuable interaction between humans and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone.",
  "1006": "In addition, there are also some false reports and fake IDs that occur on social media sites, where people use fake IDs to insult or harass others. For example, the case of Heather Chua occurred recently on Facebook.",
  "1007": "These malicious comments often go viral, and they create a strong negative effect on the real user in real life. This can lead to an unwillingness to interact with others in real life on the victim's part.",
  "1008": "In conclusion, everything has its two-sided effect and it depends on how we exploit it.",
  "1009": "With current booming technology, it is agreeable that people are becoming more technology-savvy and want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites. However, it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction; it plays an even more important role in our lives.",
  "1010": "As more and more social websites, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Weibo, have become ubiquitous, seamless, and imperative in our lives, people may worry about the young generation having problems with face-to-face communication skills.",
  "1011": "However, I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions.",
  "1012": "Social media enables us to explore the world far away without paying expensive airplane tickets or sacrificing a one-week holiday.",
  "1013": "The convenience is beyond description.",
  "1014": "With a small smartphone or a computer, at school, at work, or at home, we can easily make friends worldwide with a \"click\" and get to know about their lives through having conversations with them, reading their blogs, photos, and statuses.",
  "1015": "Compared to face-to-face interaction, online conversation is easier for strangers to open up to each other.",
  "1016": "Since some of the information has already been revealed on the homepage, it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about.",
  "1017": "Moreover, people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online, with their masks taken off in reality.",
  "1018": "This has been indicated in a report by Boston University in 2012: 80% of information posted online is true, whereas a person may only like three out of ten times in real life.",
  "1019": "This shows that a Facebook friend may know more about you than a close friend who does not have a Facebook account.",
  "1020": "That is because we are acting as we are in reality, while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world.",
  "1021": "Although sometimes genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful, such as the prevalent use of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments, we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulation of online content.",
  "1022": "Another advantage of social media is that it aids in the spread of democracy.",
  "1023": "People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments.",
  "1024": "That eliminates the disadvantage of having incomplete information in some remote rural regions, where people are less aware of what is actually happening around them.",
  "1025": "One of the examples is the 2012 riots in Egypt and Zambia.",
  "1026": "The idea of seeking democracy is spreading quickly from Egyptians to people in Zambia through the use of social media.",
  "1027": "However, since the government controls most of the media.",
  "1028": "These social media may be tools for their campaign and manipulation of the public's thoughts.",
  "1029": "For example, in the 2012 general election in Singapore, Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of Facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public.",
  "1030": "Though because of this, social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional media. (Media is a plural noun in this context so grammatical correction would be traditional media not traditional medias.)",
  "1031": "Intensive use of social media reduces the time people spend on face-to-face communication.",
  "1032": "It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around a table have cell phones in their hands.",
  "1033": "They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends, and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends.",
  "1034": "In this case, I have to say that to err is human. or",
  "1035": "What we can do is educate the public about the importance of having their friends by their side and teach them to manage their time well.",
  "1036": "In conclusion, the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages in our daily lives.",
  "1037": "What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and carefully manage our words used online.",
  "1038": "With the regulation of governments and relevant authorities, the virtual world would be a better place.",
  "1039": "The role of social media sites in connecting people around the world is undeniable.",
  "1040": "Thanks to social media, communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease.",
  "1041": "Apart from the ease of communication despite the distance, many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trades can also be done through social media.",
  "1042": " Nevertheless, with those advantages, some disadvantages may appear, such as a reduction in face-to-face human contact, which affects interpersonal skills, privacy issues, as well as frauds that can be committed through social media.",
  "1043": "Twitter, Facebook, and Skype are some social media sites that enable us to keep in touch with friends or family who are in other cities or countries.",
  "1044": "Through those sites we are able to talk to them, find out what their activities are and who their friends are, etc. From a superficial point of view, it is undeniable that these sites help us have a better relationship with our relatives, despite the distance.",
  "1045": "The sharing of information can be done faster through social media, which is why many news publishers, such as Channel News Asia with its Twitter account, now update followers with headline news.",
  "1046": "That shows how news and information can actually be shared easily through social media.",
  "1047": "Furthermore, since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media, this information can reach them easily without their needing to watch or listen to the news reports.",
  "1048": "Due to the popularity of social media, many people are starting to do their business via these sites.",
  "1049": "More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook, whether it's our friends selling their products or professional brands selling their products online. We can buy and contact the sellers through those sites, which can be considered an advantage for us, the buyers.",
  "1050": "However, is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them in person?",
  "1051": "I do think there is a difference in it, and I believe many of us will agree.",
  "1052": "When we write or communicate virtually, we can hide our true feelings and may not be ourselves because we don't want the other party to judge us.",
  "1053": "Other than that, sometimes the message of one party can't be delivered properly to the other, since communication is done through written language, and so the \"tone\" of the message sent and received may be different.",
  "1054": "Many people are very brave in telling others about their opinions online, but in real life, some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all.",
  "1055": "This will lead to bad interpersonal skills as well as a problem of trust.",
  "1056": "Nowadays, we can't really trust new people we know from social media since we never know if they are even \"real\" .",
  "1057": "Some people fake their identities on media sites so that they can meet more people or, in some cases, even cheat others.",
  "1058": "In addition, privacy issues have become more prevalent nowadays, as some people do not realize that they may be sharing information they were not willing to share in the first place.",
  "1059": "Therefore, while social media sites are undoubtedly beneficial in our lives, we should consider their drawbacks and thus use them wisely to gain more of their benefits and minimize their disadvantages.",
  "1060": "It is a common scene that almost everyone in public transport is watching a phone or wearing a pair of earphones in this modern society today.",

  "1063": "Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people because they allow them to connect to others, even from different countries.",
